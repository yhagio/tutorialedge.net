# The Story:

Originally started in December of 2014 this site began as a side hobby of mine
and has quickly grown into one of the most successful side projects I've ever
worked upon. Since its conception it's racked up well over 1,000,000 page views
and it's still growing.

It's undergone many changes since it was first created and overall I've probably
commited well over 1,000 hours towards the site and it's content. This is
something I use to hone my own programming skills and I use it as a means of
expanding my programming horizons by encouraging me to move into new areas that
I've never touched before.

# The Code

For those interested in what the code base looks like for the entire website
then be sure to check out this github repo:
[TutorialEdge.net](https://github.com/elliotforbes/tutorialedge.net)

# The Growth

Since its inception the site's shown good growth and now exceeds 12,500 hits
per month and the growth doesn't seem to be slowing down. My main aim for the
site is to become one of the best free resources on the web for learning how to
program using various new and emeging frameworks such as Laravel 5 for web
development and Java + OpenGL for game development.

# The 6 Month Plan

My plan for the site is to hit the 100 complete tutorials milestone and get the
new forum system up and running so that the site can continue to grow and
provide help on all aspects of web development. I hope to build a thriving
online community that will become the authority on all things web development
related.

# Get Involved

Want to help contribute to a growing list of articles and tutorials and improve
the open source eco-system? This site represents the perfect low barrier to
entry for those willing to make their first open source commits. Simply pull the
code locally, make some documentation changes and submit a pull request. Check
out the [get-involved](/get-involved/) page for more.
