In this tutorial, we are going to be looking at how you can use both the `async`
and `await` keywords within your TypeScript application and subsequently improve
the readibility and succinctness of your code.

## Introduction

If you have come from a Node.JS background, you'll most likely be familiar with
something we know as Callback Hell. This is where you end up with code within
your Node.JS applications that look akin to the Pyramids from ancient Giza.

```js
myAwesomeFunction(function(x) {
  mySecondFunction(x, function(y) {
    myThirdNestedFunction(y, function(z) {
      // here we handle the results of the 3 chained functions.
    });
  });
});
```

People quickly realized that this was an issue and as such Promises were
introduced to the language in order to address said issue. These promises are
objects that will eventually return as complete or as failed and they allowed us
to rewrite the above code like so:

```js
// our original promise function
myAwesomeFunction()
  // on completion would trigger this
  .then(function(result) {
    // which would in turn return another promise
    return mySecondFunction(result);
  })
  // which on completion would trigger this
  .then(function(result2) {
    // which would again return a promise
    return myThirdNestedFunction(finalResult);
  })
  // before finally executing this block
  .then(function(finalResult) {
    // and in here we could play with the result
    // of all three promise calls
    console.log(finalResult);
  })
  // within here we could catch any errors
  // in our above promises
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

Now, this was certainly an improvement, however, this isn't all that much better
and keeping track of the results of your nested function calls is painful.

Thankfully, this is what helped bring about both the `async` and the `await`
keywords.

## Async + Await Keywords

The `async` keyword within a TypeScript program lets us define an _asynchronous
function_ like so:

```ts
async function myAwesomeFunction() {
  setTimeout(() => {}, 100, "foo");
}

const result = myAwesomeFunction();
console.log(result);
// returns Promise { undefined }
```

We can then call this _asynchronous function_ in such a manner that its
execution becomes _synchronous_.

Wait, why would we want that?

By doing this, we can write code that is far cleaner and more understandable
than our chained promise example. It allows us to utilize the `await` keyword in
front of an express that will return a promise and pause the execution of the
function until the `await`-ed promise resolves with a result.

```ts
async function mySecondFunction(x: number) {
  setTimeout(() => {}, 100);
  return 2 + x;
}

async function myThirdNestedFunction(x: number) {
  setTimeout(() => {}, 100);
  return 3 + x;
}

async function myAwesomeFunction() {
  let startingValue = 1;
  // we can await the call to mySecondFunction() as this
  // returns a promise that will eventually return
  // our firstResult
  let firstResult = await mySecondFunction(startingValue);
  // once mySecondFunction has resolve, our function will
  // carry on execution of myThirdNestedFunction
  let finalResult = await myThirdNestedFunction(firstResult);
  // once this resolves, we get back our finalResult
  // which we can subsequently return
  return finalResult;
}

let promise = myAwesomeFunction();
promise.then(result => console.log(result));
```

Now, this should instantly highlight just how much better your application's
code can be by switching out chained promises and instead using these new
keywords!

The final result is far more terse, and far more readable for new developers
coming into the codebase.

## Mixing in Raw Promises

If you start working with the `async` and `await` keywords, you should note that
you don't preclude the use of raw Promises within your TypeScript applications.

The `async` keyword will still return a _promise_ which can be used in
conjunction with something like `Promise.all()`. This gives us the flexibility
to run our asynchronous functions in an asynchronous manner whilst ensuring the
execution within those functions remains synchronous. Confusing isn't it?

Let's take a look at what I mean by this in the code:

```ts
async function myAsyncFunction(input: number) {
  // the internal part of our async function
  // will still be executed synchronously thanks
  // to the await keyword
  let result = await setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Function: %d executed", input);
  }, 1000 * input);
}

Promise.all([myAsyncFunction(3), myAsyncFunction(2), myAsyncFunction(1)]);
```

When you execute this, you should see that the execution of the above array of
async functions is done asynchronously:

```js
[ Node] [nodemon] starting `node dist/app.js`
[ Node] Function: 1 executed
[ Node] Function: 2 executed
[ Node] Function: 3 executed
```

## Conclusion

Hopefully, this tutorial helped to clarify what the `async` and `await` keywords
are and how they can help you to improve the way you write your TypeScript
applications.
