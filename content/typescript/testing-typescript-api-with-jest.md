In this tutorial, we'll be looking at how you can get a very simple test
framework up and running for your TypesScript based API using the `jest` and
`supertest` testing libraries.

## Installation

Now that we have gotten the `why?` out of the way, let's see how we can go about
implementing our own testing framework:

First and foremost, we'll have to install the libraries that we wish to use to
test our systems.

```s
$ yarn add ts-jest jest supertest
```

Once you have installed the above packages, you will have to add the `test`
script to your `package.json` file within your project:

```js
{
  // name, version etc.
  "scripts": {
    // other scripts
    "test": "jest"
  },
  // dependencies etc.
  // our jest test suite configuration
  "jest": {
    "moduleFileExtensions": [
      "ts",
      "tsx",
      "js"
    ],
    "transform": {
      "^.+\\.(ts|tsx)$": "ts-jest"
    },
    "globals": {
      "ts-jest": {
        "tsConfigFile": "tsconfig.json"
      }
    },
    "testMatch": [
      "**/__tests__/*.+(ts|tsx|js)"
    ]
  }
}
```

You'll notice we've also added in the `jest` configuration to our `package.json`
in the above code snippet. This dictates where `jest` will be able to find our
tests and in this case we've dictated they'll be within our `src/__tests__/`
directory.

## A Simple Test

Ok, so we've got the necessary libraries installed, how do we then go about
using these to test our codebase?

Well, let's start by writing a really simple `jest` test suite that will test a
very simple `hello` API endpoint.

```js
import app from "../app";
import * as request from "supertest";

describe("GET / - a simple api endpoint", () => {
  it("Hello API Request", async () => {
    const result = await request(app).get("/");
    expect(result.text).toEqual("hello");
    expect(result.statusCode).toEqual(200);
  });
});
```

In the above test suite we have used the `supertest` library to make a test
request against our API endpoint `GET "/"`. This then awaits the response and
tests this response to ensure it's what we expect.

### Running our Tests

Now that we've got this test case written, let's try running our test suite by
calling the following:

```s
$ yarn run test
```

This should then return the following output:

```s
✗ yarn run test
yarn run v1.5.1
(node:10360) [DEP0005] DeprecationWarning: Buffer() is deprecated due to security and usability issues. Please use the Buffer.alloc(), Buffer.allocUnsafe(), or Buffer.from() methods instead.
$ jest
 PASS  src/__tests__/app.test.ts
  ✓ Hello API Request (3ms)

```

Excellent, we now have a running, incredibly simple testing framework that we
can start to flesh out and use to test every other endpoint or function within
our TypeScript based REST API.
