In this tutorial we’ll be looking at various ways we can obtain the current URL
of our application in Angular 2.

## The Location Service

The location service is part of the **@angular/common** module. It allows you to
interact directly with a browser’s URL and can read and redirect the user should
you wish to.

> This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with Angular 2 Routing and have an
> application that utilizes routes.

### Getting the Current Path

Getting the current application path can be handy for scenarios where you want
to show select sub-menus in say a navigation component.

In this example we’ll be working with a very simple ‘Top-Nav’ component that
will simply assign a string variable to our current path every time a route
change is observed.

```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
import { Location } from "@angular/common";
import { Router } from "@angular/router";

@Component({
  selector: "app-top-nav",
  templateUrl: "./top-nav.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./top-nav.component.scss"]
})
export class TopNavComponent implements OnInit {
  route: string;

  constructor(location: Location, router: Router) {
    router.events.subscribe(val => {
      if (location.path() != "") {
        this.route = location.path();
      } else {
        this.route = "Home";
      }
    });
  }

  ngOnInit() {}
}
```

Notice that we have to import both Location and Router at the top of our
component and then ask for them in the constructor of our component. Once we’ve
asked for them, we can let Angular 2’s dependency injection work it’s magic and
we’ll be able to subscribe to route changes as demonstrated above.
