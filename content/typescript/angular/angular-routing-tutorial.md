Routing is practically essential in all larger Angular applications, it provides
us with the ability to show different sections of html within a master template
and basically create a full-blown multi-page application.

Routing in Angular 2+ has changed dramatically from the original AngularJS days
where you would have to utilize the \$routeProvider and typically define routes
in a separate file to that of your module file.

## Defining your First Routes

The first thing that you need to do in order to add routing to your application
is append the following tag to your index.html page:

```html
<base href="/" />
```

This should be placed somewhere within your `<head></head>` tags. The
`<base href="/">` tells the Angular router what is the static part of the URL.
The router then only modifies the remaining part of the URL.

> Without the base href tag you will see errors like this:
> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34535163/angular-2-router-no-base-href-set">Angular
> 2 Router no Base href set</a>

Now that we’ve set the our base href tag, we can then move on to defining some
routes without your route module file or your `app.module.ts` file if you follow
the standard convention.

```js
import { RouterModule, Routes } from "@angular/router";
// …
const appRoutes: Routes = [
  // To represent our index page or root page we simply
  // pass in empty single quotes as our path value
  { path: "", component: HomeComponent },
  // if we want a page on http://ourapp.com/social then
  // we can define it like so and it will show the SocialComponent
  { path: "social", component: SocialComponent },
  // the same goes for settings and email
  { path: "settings", component: SettingsComponent },
  { path: "email", component: EmailComponent }
];
// …

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    // ...
    EmailComponent,
    HomeComponent,
    SettingsComponent,
    SocialComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    // ...
    RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes)
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

In this example I’ve imported the RouterModule and Routes from @angular/router
and then I’ve defined my routes as appRoutes and passed in 4 different routes
that all resolve to differing components.

I’ve then ensured that these components lie within our AppModules declarations
array and finally I’ve added the following line to the bottom of our imports
array:

```ts
RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes);
```

Finally we need to define where we want our sub-pages html to render. We can do
this by placing:

```html
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```

In our app.component.html file. In my
[example project](https://github.com/elliotforbes/angular-2-admin/blob/master/src/app/app.component.html)
you’ll see that I’ve defined this below my app-top-nav which will remain
constant for all pages throughout my application.

## Child Routes

So now that we know how to define our own routes we could keep adding and adding
them to our app.module.ts file forever right? Well what happens when we are
working with an application that features hundreds or potentially thousands of
sub-pages? Our app.module.ts would become un-maintainable and a giant mess of
routes. Thankfully Angular provides a solution to this problem by allowing us to
define child routes within sub-modules of our application.

In a sub-module of my application I can do the following:

```js
import { RouterModule, Routes } from "@angular/router";
// …
// define all the routes I want for my blog component
export const blogRoutes: Routes = [
  { path: "blog", component: BlogComponent },
  { path: "blog/new", component: BlogNewComponent }
];
// …
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // ...
    RouterModule.forChild(blogRoutes)
  ],
  declarations: [BlogComponent, BlogNewComponent],
  providers: [BlogService]
})
export class BlogModule {}
```

Above you’ll see that it looks almost identical to our `app.module.ts` except
for one key difference. Notice that in our module’s imports we’ve changed our
RouterModule import to use the forChild method and we’ve passed in our
sub-modules defined routes:

```ts
RouterModule.forChild(blogRoutes);
```

## Navigation Between Routes in HTML

Now that we’ve defined our routes we need to provide a means to navigate between
these routes in our html. If we were wanting to link to any other route in our
application then we can use the following:

```html
<a routerLink="/settings">Settings</a>
```

The above `<a/>` tag would link to our settings page that we defined above.
