> This tutorial was built of the official Angular 2.2 release.

In this tutorial we’ll be examining what modules are in Angular 2.0 as well as
how to define them, what the best practices are for using modules and what the
differences are between 1._ Modules and 2._ modules.

## What Are Modules?

Typically a module would contain all the code necessary for one cohesive piece
of functionality for your application. So say you were designing an admin
dashboard for your website or application. You would have one root module and
possibly a module for your articles section, a module for your users section, a
module for your stats section and so on.

Being able to structure your application into a series of smaller blocks of
functionality is highly advantageous as it allows for easy extendibility and
maintainability further down the line. We can group things like components,
directives and services into a single module and should we wish to use any of
these things within another module, we would simply import that module at the
top of our file like so:

```ts
// import OurService from the ourmodule folder
import { OurService } from ./ourmodule/our.module';
```

Ever Angular application contains at least one route module. Without this your
angular application simply wouldn’t work. Modules were introduced in Angular 2's
5th Release candidate and Angular 2 offers in built modules such as the
FormsModule, the HttpModule and the RouterModule. These standard modules can all
be imported into our application and will allow us to do things like perform
http calls or define routes within our application.

```bash
// Notice how all of the sub modules and components are branched off the root module like a tree.
-- Root Module
---- Users Module
------ new user component
-------- new-user.ts|html|spec.ts|css
---- Articles Module
------ New/edit/delete/search article code
---- Statistics Module
------ All our code for gathering statistics and displaying them etc.
```

## Our Main Module

Now we know every Angular application must have at the very least a root module.
This is typically a class that has been decorated with @NgModule. @NgModule
typically tells Angular how to compile and run module code. This root module
acts as your applications main entry point.

> Note that it is considered best practice to include the app.module.ts file
> within your apps root directory.

```ts
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { FormsModule } from "@angular/forms";
import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";
import { TestComponent } from "./test-component/test-component.component";

@NgModule({
  imports: [BrowserModule, FormsModule],
  declarations: [AppComponent, TestComponent],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> We can add our own custom components to the declarations array. Notice I’ve
> added TestComponent above.

### The @NgModule Decorator

In order to define a module we need to first define a class within our
application. After we've defined this class we would then have to decorate it
with the @NgModule decorator. Within this we define our metadata for this
module, this metadata declares what components, directives, services and so on
belong in this module.

Defining your own new modules is relatively simple in Angular 2. Below you'll
find the code needed to define your own UserModule module that contains a user
component and also exports this component so that other modules can utilize it.

```ts
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { UserComponent } from "./user.component";

@NgModule({
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  declarations: [UserComponent],
  exports: [UserComponent]
})
export class UserModule {}
```

And next we'll define the very simple UserComponent that the above module
references. This component will be bound to the 'user' html tag and will
basically print out own h2 title that says 'User Component', exciting I know.

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "user",
  template: "<h2>User Component</h2>"
})
export class UserComponent {}
```

In order for us to use the UserComponent within our root AppModule that we
defined above we simply have to add the following to our list of imports at the
top of our file.

```ts
import { UserModule, UserComponent } from "./users/users.module";
```

> If we failed to add UserComponent to the list of exports in our UserModule
> file then we would be unable to import it in our root Module

Once we've done this we can then utilize the <user></user> tags within any
component that lies within our root AppModule.

## Bootstrapping

In Angular 1.\* we would typically have used the ng-app directive to bootstrap
our angular application. This would act almost like a main function that would
act as the starting point for all of our Angular code.

In Angular 2 this ng-app directive no longer exists and we have to resort to
explicitly calling a bootstrap function and passing our root module to this
function.

```ts
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic";
// we import our root module file, notice the lack of file-extension
import { AppModule } from "./app.module";

// this compiles and launches our AngularJS Application for us
platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
```
