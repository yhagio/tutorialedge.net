Cookies are small packages of information that are typically stored by your
browser and websites tend to use cookies for multiple things. Cookies persist
across multiple requests and browser sessions should you set them to and they
can be a great method for authentication in some web apps.

## Limitations of Cookies

Typically we can only store no more than 20 cookies per web server and no more
than 4KB of information in each cookie and they can last indefinitely should you
choose to specify the max-age attribute.

## Setting Up

In order to play about with cookies in Angular 2 we’ll have to install the
`angular2-cookie` library by typing the following within our project:

```bash
npm install angular2-cookie --save
```

This should download angular2-cookies to our project’s node_modules folder and
also add it as a dependency to our project.

## Implementation

Once we’ve successfully added angular2-cookie to our project we can set about
using it. It’s recommended that you import the CookieService within your module
file and then add it to your providers array like so:

```ts
/*
 * Custom Libraries
 */
import { CookieService } from "angular2-cookie/services/cookies.service";

// .. all other imports

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    // ...
  ],
  imports: [
    // ..
  ],
  providers: [CookieService],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Then once we’ve added it as a provider we can utilize it in one of our component
files like so:

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { CookieService } from "angular2-cookie/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  templateUrl: "./app.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./app.component.css"]
})
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(private _cookieService: CookieService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this._cookieService.put("test", "test");
    console.log("Set Test Cookie as Test");
  }

  getCookie(key: string) {
    return this._cookieService.get(key);
  }
}
```

## Setting Cookies

In order to set cookies using this library we would have to use the following
method:

```ts
// the put method takes in the name of the cookie and the value for that cookie.
// if we wanted to define cookie options then we would pass in a third parameter to
// this method containing those options.
this._cookieService.put("test", "test");
```

## Retrieving Cookies

Once we have successfully set a cookie, we can then retrieve that same cookie by
using the `.get(cookie)` method like so:

```ts
// This would retrieve the previously defined 'test' cookie
this._cookieService.get("test");
```
