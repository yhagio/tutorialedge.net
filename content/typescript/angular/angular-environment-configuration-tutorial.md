If you are developing serious applications there is a very good chance that you
will have more than one environment. You’ll have at least one testing
environment to harmlessly break things in and a polished production environment
that is supposed to remain as stable as possible.

Angular, or more specifically the angular-cli provides a very good mechanism for
having multiple differing configuration files and for building these files
easily into your finished build artefacts.

## Why Is This Necessary

Say for instance you are developing a new Administration dashboard for your
website that interacts with a REST API that updates your articles. Now imagine
you wanted to develop and test new features, without potentially breaking your
existing application for people using your site. How would you test new features
without impacting your existing application?

This is where different environments will help, ideally you would have at
minimum 2 environments. One testing environment which interacts with a test REST
API and a test Database.

## How Do You Manage the Configuration?

So the most basic way of managing two different environments is to just change a
variable or two every time you want to test or deploy something. But then what
happens when our app becomes increasingly sophisticated and requires hundreds of
different configuration variables?

The most popular answer to this is to move all of this configuration to a set of
configuration or ‘environment’ files. If your application was built using the
Angular-CLI then you should notice an `environment` directory within your `src`
directory.

The default file is your `environment.ts` file which should look like so:

```js
// The file contents for the current environment will overwrite these during build.
// The build system defaults to the dev environment which uses `environment.ts`, but if you do
// `ng build --env=prod` then `environment.prod.ts` will be used instead.
// The list of which env maps to which file can be found in `angular-cli.json`.

export const environment = {
  production: false
};
```

## Adding Your Own Configuration

So in this example, we want to be able to easily switch between APIs depending
on what environment we are in.

In our standard `environment.ts` file we can define the api location of our test
REST API:

```js
// The file contents for the current environment will overwrite these during build.
// The build system defaults to the dev environment which uses `environment.ts`, but if you do
// `ng build --env=prod` then `environment.prod.ts` will be used instead.
// The list of which env maps to which file can be found in `angular-cli.json`.

export const environment = {
  production: false,
  api_url: "http://localhost:8000"
};
```

And in our `environment.prod.ts` file we can define our production REST API:

```ts
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  api_url: "http://localhost:9000"
};
```

## Importing These Variables Where They Are Needed:

So now that we’ve defined these variables, how do we reference these in our
environment files?

So typically we interact with APIs using services, in this example we’ll be
interacting with a `user` api. At the top of our service file we add:
`import { environment } from ‘../../environments/environment’;`

This then references whatever production file we need depending on the arguments
we pass to our build or serve command.

## Building For Different Environments

The Angular CLI provides both a build and serve command for use that takes in an
environment argument. Whenever we want to build our application for a specific
environment we do the following:

```bash
ng build -e prod
```

And change `prod` to the environment that we want. Leaving it blank will default
it to the standard test environment config. The built files in the dist folder
can then be pushed up to wherever you are hosting your application.

If we wanted to run the serve command for our test environment we would then do:

```bash
ng serve
```
