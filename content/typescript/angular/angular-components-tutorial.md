Most new frontend frameworks feature this concept of components and
compartmentalizing blocks of code into distinct blocks that can be reused in
multiple locations around your application. In Angular 2 we can do this by
creating our own components.

## What Are Components?

In Angular we can define these things we call components. These components are
functional blocks of code that we can attach to html tags. Say for instance we
are creating an application that mimics facebook, we want a to display a small
widget on the side of the page that shows the current users current profile
picture, as well as some other pieces of information. We could encapsulate all
the functionality of this widget into a component.

### Why Are Components Used?

When we split our applications into numerous components and sub-components we
are essentially breaking down our problems into smaller and smaller problems. We
create a loosely coupled system of components that can be easily changed and
tested without potentially impacting anything else in our system.

> From a development point of view this is hugely beneficial, huge teams of
> developers can work on a single application without worrying about pushing
> other bugs into production.

## Creating a Simple Component

If you’ve come from an Angular 1.\* background then you should find creating
components to be a little bit simpler in Angular2. In Angular 2 we have done
away with controllers and controller files and merged them straight into one
single component file. In this component file we essentially define our
controller as a class and then we annotate this class using the @Component({ …
}) angular annotation.

```ts
// first we have to import Component
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

// next we annotate our UserComponent class
@Component({
  selector: "user",
  template: "<h2>User</h2>"
})
// we define our class
export class UserComponent {}
```

## @Component Decorator

- _selector_ - This defines what HTML tag we will bind to. In the above example
  we bind to the `<user></user>` tag.
- _template_ - In this we define what html we wish to render for this component.
  In the above component we are simply going to print out a very simple `<h2>`
  tag.
- _templateUrl_ - this is an alternative to _template_, we can define a html
  file which will contain all the html content for this component. This is
  typically used for situations where there is a lot of html and it makes sense
  to split it apart from the main component file.
- _styles_ - This option allows us to define specific styles that will be unique
  to our component.
- _directives_ - If we want to access a directive then we would pass it into our
  component using this option.
- _providers_ - Here we pass in any services that we want to utilize within our
  component.

## Creating Components using the Angular-CLI

If you've built your project using the Angular-CLI then creating new components
that work straight away is easy:

```bash
ng g component your_component_name
```
