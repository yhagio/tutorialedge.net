### Course Outline

Over this course I’m aiming to introduce you to key strategies used by game
developers when implementing Artificial Intelligence systems into their own
games. I’ll be covering popular algorithms such as the A\* search algorithm,
breadth first, depth first, Alpha-beta pruning and more and hopefully give you a
good grounding of the basics of artificial intelligence.

I’m going to start of by introducing concepts such as agents and rationality and
then build up to implementing a number of highly-used Artificial Intelligence
algorithms.
