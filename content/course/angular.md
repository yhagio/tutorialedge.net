#### Course Outline

Angular 2 is the latest iteration of the wildly successful Angular framework and
this course is designed to take you all the way from the basics through to
creating high-quality angular applications.

> This course is built using a minimum of **Angular 2.2**. I've also focused on
> building these tutorials purely in Typescript.

If you are interested in buying books to aid in your learning of the Angular
framework then I suggest you checkout my list of
