In this course I'll be demonstrating the absolute fundamentals to developing applications with AngularJS 1.X. We'll begin by creating a very simple admin application that will perform multiple tasks such as consuming RESTful APIs, Lazy Loading articles and more. 

We’ll begin by creating some very simple Single Page Applications or SPAs and then build up on these until we’ve covered everything you need in order to develop your own web applications using the AngularJS framework.
