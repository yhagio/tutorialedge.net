This past month I was fortunate enough to make the leap from junior to senior engineer with the company I currently work for and I was delighted. With this new-found fame and glory, I thought I would share some of the key learning points that I have taken away from the past few years which may help hopefully others looking to make the leap from junior to senior. 

> **Note** - Your mileage may vary. 

# Communication and Soft Skills

This is without a doubt **the most important learning point** that I've taken away from my past few years of work. 

The vast majority of successful projects take strong teams in order to get off the ground and a strong team is built up of great communicators with the soft skills required to work together efficiently.

Throughout the last year, the team I have been part of has been truly exceptional. We are all strong communicators who work incredibly well together
