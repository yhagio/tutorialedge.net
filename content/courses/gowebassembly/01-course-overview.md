In this course, we are going to be covering the fundamentals you'll need to know in order to start developing your own WebAssembly applications in Go

By the end of this course, we will have covered things like compiling your Go code to wasm files as well as how we can optimize for the size of these files. We'll also be covering the fundamentals like DOM-manipulation as well as how you can call out to JavaScript to execute JavaScript functions and access JavaScript variables.
