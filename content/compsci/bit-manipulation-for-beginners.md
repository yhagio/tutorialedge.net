In this tutorial we will be taking a look at bit manipulation and how you can
use it to optimize some of the different parts of your systems when you are
programming.

> In this tutorial we will be using Python 3.6 in order to demonstrate some of
> the concepts covered.

## Shift Left

By shifting left we are essentially multiplying our original number by 2 \* the
number of times we shift left.

```py
>>> 16 << 1 ## 16 shifted left once = 16 * 2
32
>>> 16 << 2 ## 16 shifted left twice = 16 * (2 * 2)
64
```

Let's now look at the binary representation for these numbers and how shifting
left affects them.

```py
10000 ## 16 in binary
10000 << 1 ## shift left once
100000 ## Returns 32 in binary, we have shifted one bit to the left

10000 ## 16 in binary
10000 << 2 ## shift left twice
1000000 ## returns 64 in binary, we have shifted 2 bits to the left
```

## Shift Right

It should be noted that there are two distinct types of shift right. These are
arithmetic shift rights and logical shift rights.

### Arithmetic Shift Right

Arithmetic shift rights essentially perform a division on whatever number was
put into it. If we performed an arithmetic shift right on the value `16` in
Python and shifted it right `1` then our output would be `8`. If we shifted
right twice our output would be `4` as we are essentially dividing by 4.

```py
>>> 16 >> 1
8
>>> 16 >> 2
4
```

Let's take a look at the binary representation of these numbers:

```py
10000 ## 16 in binary
10000 >> 1 ## 16 / 2
01000 ## 01000 = 8 in binary
```

If we were to shift right twice on an odd number we would see the following:

```py
1001 ## 9 in binary
1001 >> 1 ## 9 / 2
0100 ## Output is 4 in binary. It has rounded down
```

## Bit Logical Operators

In this section of the tutorial we are going to take a look at the logical
operators that can be used in conjunction with your bits.

### Bitwise And

Bitwise and will return a `1` if both values to the left and right of our `&`
operator are `1`. This results in the following output when we try it across
various different inputs.

```py
>>> 1 & 1
1
>>> 1 & 0
0
>>> 0 & 1
0
>>> 0 & 0
0
```

### Bitwise Or

Bitwise Or can be done using the `|` operator in Python and will return a `1` if
either or _both_ of our values are `1`.

```py
>>> 0 | 1
1
>>> 1 | 0
1
>>> 0 | 0
0
>>> 1 | 1
1
```

### Bitwise XOR

A Bitwise exclusive or `(XOR)` can be achieved using the `^` operator. This will
return the following results:

```py
>>> 1 ^ 1
0
>>> 1 ^ 0
1
>>> 0 ^ 1
1
>>> 0 ^ 0
0
```

## Complex Bit Manipulation

Now that we have covered the basics in Bit manipulation we can start to look at
the more complex tasks such as setting a bit, clearing a bit or getting a bit.
The vast majority of these tasks can be performed by first creating what we
would call a `bit mask` and then using this with one of the logical operators
that we have previously covered.

A bit mask typically looks something like `0010000` and we can use this for
doing things like setting, getting or clearing a bit in the `5th` bit position.
If this doesn't make sense right now hopefully after the next few examples it
will start to become clearer.

### Setting a Bit

```py
def set_bit(position, binary):
    ## Create a bit mask based on the
    ## position passed in
    ## produces '10000' if we pass in position=4
    ## our bit in the '4th' position is set to 1
    bit_mask = 1 << position
    ## return our binary string or-ed with our mask
    return bit_mask | binary

## This should return 16
print(set_bit(4, 00000000))
```

<!--### Getting a Bit

### Clearing a Bit -->

### Conclusion

So, in this tutorial, we have looked at bit manipulation and how you can utilize bit manipulation techniques within your own Python applications.
