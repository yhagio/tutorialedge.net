In this tutorial we are going to look at the `queue` data structure. We'll take
a look at how this data structure can be used for various tasks and the various
sort of things you can do with queues.

## Introduction

The `queue` data structure is typically used in scenarios where you want things
to be processed in the same order that they were inputted into a system.

For example, imagine you had a system that dealt with user registrations to your
site. You could enqueue any new requests from users to register to your site
into a `queue`. Worker threads within your application would then monitor this
`queue` and process new registrations as they come in.

```py
>>> import queue
>>> my_q = queue.Queue()
>>> my_q.put('first')
>>> my_q.put('second')
>>> my_q.put('third')
>>> my_q.get()
'first'
>>> my_q.get()
'second'
>>> my_q.get()
'third'
```
