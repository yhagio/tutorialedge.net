So, in this tutorial, we are going to be looking at Hash Tables and how they can
be used within our applications for fame and fortune. By the end of this
tutorial, you should have a solid grasp of these Hash Tables and how they work
under the covers.

## An Introduction

So, the first place we should start with is, what are hash tables? Hash Tables
in Computer Science are a data structure that allow you to store key value pairs
in such a way that allows for very quick look-up.

By knowing how hashmaps work fundamentally, we can drastically improve the
performance of certain parts of our applications by leveraging this knowledge.

### An Example

Let's take for example a hypothetical example in which we filter a stream of
incoming tweets. Every time we receive a tweet, we need to check if we care
about the author of that particular tweet.

Now, we could use an array to store a list of authors we care about and then
enumerate through this list every time we get a new tweet in.

```py
tweet_author = "realpython"
authors = ["elliot_f", "golangweekly", "realpython"]

for author in authors:
  if author == tweet_author:
    print("We care about this tweet")
```

This would certainly work. However, what happens when we increase the number of
authors we want to keep track of?

For each new author, we'll essentially be doing 1 more comparison per tweet. If
we are tracking 100 authors, and we get a tweet from someone we don't follow,
then we have done 100 unnecessary comparisons. Scale this up for the hundreds of
millions of tweets that go out every day and we've done a tonne of unnecessary
work.

#### Using Hashmaps

We can improve the performance of our code above through the use of a hashmap.

Every time a new tweet comes in, we can take the tweet_author string and compute
a hash. We can then almost instantly check to see if this hash matches something
within our hashmap in `O(1)` time complexity and then decide what to do with
that tweet if it is from one of the authors we are following:

```py
tweet_author = "golangweekly"
authors = {"elliot_f":True, "realpython":True, "golangweekly":True}

if authors[tweet_author]:
  print("We care about this tweet")
```

With this implementation, if we receive a tweet from an author that we don't
follow, we are only performing one simple hashing computation and a lookup to
check. This will drastically improve the speed at which our code can execute at
scale.

## Performance

_Good_ Hash Tables with minimal collisions allow you to perform inserts, finds
and deletes in a constant amount of time, this can be expressed as `O(1)` in
big-O notation.

This constant timing makes them incredibly valuable data-structures when
compared to the likes of Arrays for instance. If we were tasked with the job of
finding an element in `array`, we would typically have to iterate through all
elements of that `array` before we found what we were looking for. Depending on
the size of our `array`, this could be a fairly time-consuming task.

### Fill Factor

When we talk about hash tables and their implementation, we have to consider the
`Fill Factor` of that particular hash table.

Hash tables with a high `Fill Factor` will tend to have a high number of
collisions and as the `Fill Factor` of your hash table increases, the
performance of said hash table starts to degrade.

## Hashing Algorithms

When designing a hash table, we need to come up with a good hashing algorithm
that meets the following basic requirements:

- It must be efficient.
- It must compute the same hash value for equal objects.
- It should uniformly distribute our Hashes so that we don't have clusters of
  hashes.
- It should have a low hash collision factor.

Typically, in languages like Python, these Hashing algorithms are provided for
you and differ depending on the type of data you are hashing. However, they tend
to give you the ability to come up with your own hashing algorithms should you
wish.

## A Simple Example in Python

Now that we have covered some of the basic theory underlying Hash Tables, let's
have a look at how we would use Hash Tables within our Python applications.

We'll be using a Python `dict` data type in this example as the `dict` is an
implementation of a hash table.

```py
## we can initialize an empty dict using curly braces like so
hash_table = {}
## next, we append an key which will be hashed, and a value
hash_table["random"] = "string"
## we can then retrieve the value of our hashed string like so
## the hashing of "random" takes O(1) time
print(hash_table["random"])
```
