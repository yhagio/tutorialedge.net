Binary trees are a really cool data structure that feature a series of `nodes` that have at most two child `nodes`. 

# Ordered Binary Trees

`Ordered binary trees` are a type of `binary tree` where each `node` within the tree has a value greater than their left child `node` and less than their right child `node`.
