Binary trees are a really cool data structure that feature a series of `nodes`
that have at most two child `nodes`.

## Ordered Binary Trees

`Ordered binary trees` are a type of `binary tree` where each `node` within the
tree has a value greater than their left child `node` and less than their right
child `node`.
