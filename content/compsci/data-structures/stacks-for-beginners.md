In this tutorial, we are going to be taking a look at stacks in Computer Science
and how they can be used to effectively solve problems that we may face as
software developers.

## Stacks - The Theory

I think the best way to imagine the stack data structure is to imagine a stack
of pancakes. Typically, when you add a new pancake, it has to go on to the top
of the existing pile. If you want to conversely eat a pancake from the stack,
you have to pop the top one off and into your mouth.

From this, we can see that when we are working with stacks, we have the ability
to perform two main actions. We can:

- **Push** - add a new element to the top of the collection
- **Pop** - remove the top element from our collection

This makes it a somewhat interesting and quite easy _abstract data type_ to
implement as there isn't a whole lot to them.

Some implementations may include the functionality to `peek` the top element of
our stack, but it isn't absolutely necessary. This is akin to peeking at the top
pancake in our pile and inspecting it.

## A Simple Array Based Example

Let's consider how we would implement this in Python. We'll need to store a
collection of elements, so an `array` makes sense to base our implementation off
of.

```py
class Stack:
    """a simple implementation of the stack data structure"""
    def __init__(self, e):
        print("Initialized Stack")
        self.elements = []
        self.elements = e

    def push(self, element):
        self.elements.append(element)

    def pop(self):
        return self.elements.pop(-1)
```

If we walk this through, our `push` function takes in an element and appends it
to the end of our `elements` array. In our `pop` function, we simply return the
last element of our `elements` array.

> **Note -** - This is an incredibly basic, non-thread safe implementation of a
> `stack`.

## Conclusion

Hopefully you found this tutorial useful. If you have any suggestions as to how
this could be improved then I would love to hear them in the suggestions section
down below.
