If you haven't heard already AWS recently announced support for creating AWS
Lambda functions using the Go programming language. As a huge fan of the
language and of AWS itself I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to
combine both and create a simple tutorial on how to create your own Lambda
functions in Go.
