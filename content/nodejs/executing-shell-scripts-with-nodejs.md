  shell scripts from within your nodejs application.

<p>One of the problems I’ve been faced with recently is how do I go about executing shell scripts using NodeJS. This essentially allows me to query the status of certain processes and utilize the full power of the unix shell commands. </p>

<h2>Implementation using NodeJS child_process Module</h2>

<p>Node thankfully already has a module which is designed specifically for executing shell scripts and can be found <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html" target="_blank">here</a> in the documentation.</p>

<p>This module essentially creates a child process in which we can execute our shell script and also sets everything up for us so that we can utilize stdin, stdout and stderr within our NodeJS application. </p>

## Executing Unix or Windows Commands

We can use the exec function to run a wide range of windows and unix commands
and also pass any number of arguments to this command should we need to.

```js
const ls = spawn("ls", ["-lh", "/usr"]);
```

Whilst there may be times that we aren't interested in the output of any of the
commands that we run, more often than not we need to capture the output so that
we can check that everything worked well.

```js
const ls = spawn("ls", ["-lh", "/usr"]);

ls.stdout.on("data", function(data) {
  console.log(data);
});

ls.stderr.on("data", function(data) {
  console.log(data);
});

ls.on("close", function(code) {
  console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
});
```

## Executing Shell Scripts

In the below example you’ll see how we can utilize callbacks in order to access
the data from stdout and stderr and subsequently view any errors and output our
shell scripts output.

```js
const exec = require('child_process').exec, child;
const testscript = exec('sh myscript.sh /directory');

testscript.stdout.on('data', function(data){
    console.log(data);
    // sendBackInfo();
});

testscript.stderr.on('data', function(data){
    console.log(data);
    // triggerErrorStuff();
});
```

## Conclusion

Through this method I was able to wrap some pretty mundane and annoying scripts
in an automated fashion and tie them together in a concise and automated
fashion. This helped to reduce the amount of time spent configuring the scripts
and allowed me to focus more on the results.
