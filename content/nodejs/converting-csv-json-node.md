In this tutorial I’m going to be showing you how we can create a NodeJS script
that takes in a csv file and outputs the contents of that CSV file as JSON.

In order to do this conversion we’ll be using the
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/csvtojson">csvtojson</a> node package.
This package will do pretty much all the heavy lifting for us and having used it
in production environments I can say that it’s remarkably easy to implement into
a project.

## Setting Up Your Project

Create a new project directory on your machine and open up this location in your
terminal. Next we’ll want to install the <b>csvtojson</b> node module, you can
do that by typing the following:

```bash
npm install csvtojson --save
```

This should create a <b>node_modules</b> directory within your project which
will contain all the dependencies that csvtojson requires.

## Implementation

Now that we’ve got everything set up we can begin implementation. Open up your
project in your prefered text editor and create a new js file. Within this file
add the following code.

```js
//require the csvtojson converter class
var Converter = require("csvtojson").Converter;
// create a new converter object
var converter = new Converter({});

// call the fromFile function which takes in the path to your
// csv file as well as a callback function
converter.fromFile("./path-to-your-file.csv", function(err, result) {
  // if an error has occured then handle it
  if (err) {
    console.log("An Error Has Occured");
    console.log(err);
  }
  // create a variable called json and store
  // the result of the conversion
  var json = result;

  // log our json to verify it has worked
  console.log(json);
});
```
