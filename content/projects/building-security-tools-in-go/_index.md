Security is something we all need to be aware of as application developers. I have seen far too many developers who seem to take security for granted and leave the hardening of their applications to the later stages of development. 

In reality, every decision you make when building applications needs to be made with security in mind or you could end up exposing your customer's private information to unscrupulous characters across the dark web.

### Goals

The goal of this course is two parts:

* The first is to teach you how you can build security tools in Go
* The second is to introduce some of the basic techniques that penetration tests use to gain access to your important private information.
