### Project Outline

The goal of this project is to show you everything it takes to build a complete, fully functioning frontend application using the VueJS framework. We'll walk through everything from setting up your project, to hitting a few APIs in order to retrieve any articles and rendering these nicely on our site!

Throughout this project we will be integrating with the [HackerNews API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) so that we can focus on the frontend JavaScript code and not have to worry about implementing the backend.

We'll cover the following topics:

* Setting up a VueJS project using the vue-cli
* Creating your first component
* An introduction to routing in your Single Page Application
* Hitting API endpoints in your components
* Dynamic routing in a Single Page Application

If you wish for me to extend this or feel I should expand upon anything then please let me know by tweeting me: [@Elliot_F](https://twitter.com/elliot_f)
