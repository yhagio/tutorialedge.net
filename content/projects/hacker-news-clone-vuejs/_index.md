#### Project Outline

The goal of this project is to show you everything it takes to build a complete,
fully functioning frontend application using the VueJS framework. We'll walk
through everything from setting up your project, to hitting a few APIs in order
to retrieve any articles and rendering these nicely on our site!

Throughout this project we will be integrating with the
[HackerNews API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) so that we can focus on the
frontend JavaScript code and not have to worry about implementing the backend.

We'll cover the following topics:

- Setting up a VueJS project using the vue-cli
- Creating your first component
- An introduction to routing in your Single Page Application
- Hitting API endpoints in your components
- Dynamic routing in a Single Page Application

If you wish for me to extend this or feel I should expand upon anything then

Feel free to steal this and use this for your own personal gain, but if you do
end up making a million off it, I expect at least a beer if you ever stumble
across me in the wild!
