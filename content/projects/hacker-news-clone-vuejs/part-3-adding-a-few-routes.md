In the previous tutorial of this series, we covered single page components and
how you could build your own components and subsequently render them within your
Vue.js application. We created a simple `Navbar` component and registered it
within our `App.vue` component and subsequently rendered it within our
application.

In this tutorial, we are going to be creating a few more single-page components
and setting up a `vue-router` so that we can navigate between different views on
our site. This will enable us to view the Top Stories on our `/` path, we'll
then be expanding upon these routes as we progress through the rest of this
series and start adding more components.

## Setting Up Our Vue Router

With the new version of the `vue-cli` we'll have to first add the router to our
project before we can go about setting up routes. We can do that like so:

```s
$ vue add router
? Use history mode for router? (Requires proper server setup for index fallback in production) (Y/n) Y
```

Now, this is going to modify some of our existing files and the structure of
some of our components. But don't worry, these changes actually simplify things
for us in the long run.

You should notice that a new file called `src/router.js` has been created for
us. It is within this file that we'll define the various routes for our
application and it should look like this initially:

```js
import Vue from "vue";
import Router from "vue-router";
import Home from "./views/Home.vue";

Vue.use(Router);

export default new Router({
  mode: "history",
  base: process.env.BASE_URL,
  routes: [
    {
      path: "/",
      name: "home",
      component: Home
    },
    {
      path: "/about",
      name: "about",
      // route level code-splitting
      // this generates a separate chunk (about.[hash].js) for this route
      // which is lazy-loaded when the route is visited.
      component: () =>
        import(/* webpackChunkName: "about" */ "./views/About.vue")
    }
  ]
});
```

Let's dig in to what is going on here. So on lines `1-2` we should see the
imports of the necessary `vue` and `vue-router` packages. Below that however, it
will have imported the `Home` view from a newly generated `src/views/Home.vue`
component file.

It is within this generated file that we'll be displaying the top articles that
you would traditionally see on the homepage of HackerNews.

Finally, we tell our Vue application to use the `vue-router` - `router` before
then creating a new `Router` which contains all of ours applications routes.

Each of our routes is a combination of a path, the name of our path, and the
component we wish to render when we hit this path. Should we wish, we can also
do cool stuff such as dynamic route matching which we will cover in more detail
in part 5 of this project.

## Modifying our Home.vue View Component

Now, the autogenerated `Home.vue` component will look a little something like
this:

```html
<template>
  <div class="home">
    <img alt="Vue logo" src="../assets/logo.svg" />
    <HelloWorld msg="Welcome to Your Vue.js App" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  // @ is an alias to /src
  import HelloWorld from "@/components/Homepage.vue";

  export default {
    name: "home",
    components: {
      HelloWorld
    }
  };
</script>
```

We'll want to modify it ever so slightly to remove the import of the
`HelloWorld` component and just render `Home Page` for now like so:

```html
<template>
  <div class="home">
    <h2>Home Page</h2>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    name: "home"
  };
</script>
```

If you now have a look at the `App.vue` component, you should see that our
`Navbar` component has been removed by the `vue` cli. It has instead been
replaced by the following:

```html
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <div id="nav">
      <router-link to="/">Home</router-link> |
      <router-link to="/about">About</router-link>
    </div>
    <router-view />
  </div>
</template>

<style></style>
```

The newly added `<router-link>` components essentially act as anchor tags within
our VueJS application. It's the job of the `<router-view/>` component to render
the appropriate component for the current path within the application.

So, if we are on the homepage of our application, or `/`, we'll want to display
our `Home.vue` component. If we are on `/about`, then the `<router-view/>`
component will show the `About.vue` component that has been automatically
generated for us.

### Updating our Navbar.vue Component

Let's steal the new `<router-link>` components from our `App.vue` file and place
them within our `src/components/Navbar.vue` component file that we created
earlier on in the series:

```html
<template>
  <div class="pure-menu pure-menu-horizontal">
    <div class="container">
      <router-link to="/" class="pure-menu-heading pure-menu-link"
        >Home</router-link
      >
      <ul class="pure-menu-list">
        <li class="pure-menu-item">
          <router-link class="pure-menu-link" to="/about">About</router-link>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    name: "Navbar"
  };
</script>

<style scoped>
  .pure-menu {
    background-color: #e17842;
  }
  .pure-menu a {
    color: white;
  }
</style>
```

And finally, we'll update our `App.vue` component to once again import and
render this `Navbar.vue` component:

```html
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <navbar></navbar>
    <router-view />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import Navbar from "@/components/Navbar";
  export default {
    name: "App",
    components: {
      Navbar
    }
  };
</script>

<style></style>
```

Awesome, now when we navigate back our browser and view
`http://localhost:8080/#/`, you should now see our Homepage `<h2>Homepage</h2>`
being rendered in all its glory.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we managed to create a few more components within our Vue.js
application and set up the `vue router` which enables us to navigate between
different components with ease. Currently, this only renders the one route, but
in the next couple of tutorials, we will be using this to dynamically render our
components depending on the user's location within our application.

In the next tutorial, we are going to look at how we can extend this
`Homepage.vue` component so that it starts hitting the HackerNews API and starts
to retrieve all of the Top Stories currently trending on the site. You can find
