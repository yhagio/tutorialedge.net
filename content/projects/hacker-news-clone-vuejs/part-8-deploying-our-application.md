In this final lesson in the series, we are going to be taking a look at how you
can deploy your finished application up to AWS so that it is available for the
world.

We'll cover how to do this in an automated fashion using the Travis-CI platform
and we'll also cover some of the various methods of improving performance using
services such as CloudFront.

## Setting up a CI/CD Pipeline

Now that we have a basic level of functionality within our application, it makes
sense to deploy it, have our users see it, and interact with it and hopefully
provide feedback on it as soon as possible.

By getting feedback from the users of any of our project early, we can better
decide what parts we should focus on next to improve user experience and
basically improve the overall quality of our application.

This iterative approach to building up our application is something I would
recommend doing with **all** your projects. Get it in the hands of your users as
soon as possible and build based on their feedback.

### How a Pipeline Helps

When you start seriously developing a project or application, there comes a time
where the amount of time you spend on deploying the newer versions of that
application surpass the amount of time it takes to implement a continuous
integration/continuous deployment pipeline (CI/CD pipeline for short).

The earlier on you implement a good CI/CD pipeline in your project, the more
time you save in the long run, so doing this right and from the start can
certainly improve the chances of a successful project.

### Travis-CI

For this particular course, we are going to be using the free-to-use
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). If you are developing open-source
libraries, applications, etc... then this is _the_ tool to use for continuously
testing and deploying your stuff.

## Conclusion

Hopefully you found this final part of the series educational! These courses
take a long time to develop and fine tune over time, so if you can, I would
massively appreciate you sharing this course with your friends and getting the
word out so that I can spend more time developing these courses.
