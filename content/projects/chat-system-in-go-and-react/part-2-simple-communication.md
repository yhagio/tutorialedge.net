So, now that we have our basic frontend and backend set up, it's time to
actually do something with them.

In this part of the series, we'll be implementing a basic WebSocket server which
will listen for messages and write them back to via the same WebSocket.

By the end of this part of the series, we'll have a frontend application that
can communicate directly with our backend in a two-way fashion.

## Server

Let's start with our backend WebSocket server. We'll be using the
`github.com/gorilla/websocket` package in order to set up our WebSocket
endpoints and both read and write to our WebSocket connections.

In order to install this, we'll need to run this command within our `backend/`
directory:

```s
$ go get github.com/gorilla/websocket
```

Once we have the package installed successfully, we can start building up our
web server. We'll start by creating a really simple `net/http` server:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func setupRoutes() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Simple Server")
    })
}

func main() {
    setupRoutes()
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}

```

This will run on `http://localhost:8080` and can be started by calling
`go run main.go`. If you navigate to this in the browser, you should see
`Simple Server` outputted in plaintext.

## The WebSocket Protocol

Before we start fleshing this out, it's worthwhile covering the theory behind
how this will work.

WebSockets basically offer us duplex communication from a non-trusted source to
a server that we own across a TCP socket connection. This essentially means
that, instead of continually polling our web server for updates and having to
perform TCP handshakes every time we poll, we can maintain a single TCP socket
connection and then send and listen to messages on that.

This drastically reduces the amount of network overhead that is required for the
likes of any real-time application and it allows us to maintain an incredible
amount of clients on a single server instance.

### The Cons

WebSockets definitely come with a few cons that are worth considering. As soon
as you introduce state, it becomes more complex with regards to scaling up your
application across multiple instances.

You have to consider options such as storing your state in message brokers, or
in databases/memory caches that can scale in parallel with your application
instances.

### The Implementation

When it comes to implementing a WebSocket endpoint, we need to create a new
endpoint and then upgrade the connection from a standard HTTP endpoint to a
long-lasting WebSocket connection.

Thankfully, the `gorilla/websocket` package features the functionality we need
in order to easily upgrade a HTTP connection to a WebSocket connection with
minimal fuss.

> [RFC-6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)

## Creating a WebSocket Endpoint

Now that we have covered the theory, let's look at how we can do it in practice.
Let's create a new endpoint `/ws` which we will convert from a standard `http`
endpoint to a `ws` endpoint.

This endpoint will do 3 things, it'll check the origin of our incoming `HTTP`
request and then just return `true` to open up our endpoint to every client.
We'll then attempt to upgrade the connection using a defined `upgrader`.

Finally, we'll start listening for incoming messages and simply print them out
and echo them back to the same connection. This will allow us to verify that our
frontend can connect and send/receive messages from our newly created WebSocket
endpoint:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/gorilla/websocket"
)

// We'll need to define an Upgrader
// this will require a Read and Write buffer size
var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{
    ReadBufferSize:  1024,
  WriteBufferSize: 1024,

  // We'll need to check the origin of our connection
  // this will allow us to make requests from our React
  // development server to here.
  // For now, we'll do no checking and just allow any connection
  CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool { return true },
}

// define a reader which will listen for
// new messages being sent to our WebSocket
// endpoint
func reader(conn *websocket.Conn) {
    for {
    // read in a message
        messageType, p, err := conn.ReadMessage()
        if err != nil {
            log.Println(err)
            return
        }
    // print out that message for clarity
        fmt.Println(string(p))

        if err := conn.WriteMessage(messageType, p); err != nil {
            log.Println(err)
            return
        }

    }
}

// define our WebSocket endpoint
func serveWs(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Println(r.Host)

  // upgrade this connection to a WebSocket
  // connection
    ws, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)
    if err != nil {
        log.Println(err)
  }
  // listen indefinitely for new messages coming
  // through on our WebSocket connection
    reader(ws)
}

func setupRoutes() {
  http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Simple Server")
  })
  // mape our `/ws` endpoint to the `serveWs` function
    http.HandleFunc("/ws", serveWs)
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Chat App v0.01")
    setupRoutes()
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}

```

If everything goes to plan, you should be able to run this by calling
`go run main.go` and it will automatically kick off our server.

## Client

Now that we've set up our server, we need something that will be able to
interact with it. This is where our ReactJS frontend comes in to play.

We'll keep this relatively simple and define an `api/index.js` file which will
contain our WebSocket connection code.

```js
// api/index.js
var socket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080/ws");

let connect = () => {
  console.log("Attempting Connection...");

  socket.onopen = () => {
    console.log("Successfully Connected");
  };

  socket.onmessage = msg => {
    console.log(msg);
  };

  socket.onclose = event => {
    console.log("Socket Closed Connection: ", event);
  };

  socket.onerror = error => {
    console.log("Socket Error: ", error);
  };
};

let sendMsg = msg => {
  console.log("sending msg: ", msg);
  socket.send(msg);
};

export { connect, sendMsg };
```

So, in the above code, we have defined 2 functions that we've subsequently
exported. These are `connect()` and `sendMsg(msg)`.

The first of which, connects to the WebSocket endpoint in question and listens
for events such as successful connection with `onopen`. If it sees any issue
such as a closed socket or an error, it will proceed to print out these issues
to the browser console.

The second function, our `sendMsg(msg)` function, allows us to send messages
from our frontend to our backend via our WebSocket connection using
`socket.send()`. Nice and simple!

Let's now update our `App.js` file within our React project and add the call to
`connect()` and create a `<button/>` element which triggers our `sendMsg()`
function.

```js
// App.js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import "./App.css";
import { connect, sendMsg } from "./api";

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    connect();
  }

  send() {
    console.log("hello");
    sendMsg("hello");
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <button onClick={this.send}>Hit</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Upon successfully compiling this, we should see in our browser a solitary button
element, and if you open up your browser console, you should also see that it
has been able to successfully connect to our backend WebSocket server running on
`http://localhost:8080`.

## Conclusion

So, thus concludes part 2 of this series. We've been able to create a really
simple WebSocket server that echo's back any messages sent to it.

This step, is a critical first step in developing our application and now that
we have the basics up and running, we can start to look at implementing basic
chat functionality and making our app useful!
