## Introduction

Welcome back to part 3 of my course on building a blog with Vue.JS on AWS. In
this part of the course, we are going to be setting up an RDS instance which
will store all of our blog's articles and posts.

Once we have our database instance set up and our schema defined, we can then
move on to building Lambda functions that will query this database and return
the results to our frontend.

These Functions will do as follows:

- Return all blog posts - This will return a paginated JSON list of all of the
  blog posts within our database
- Return single blog post - This will return a JSON object containing one
  particular blog post
- Create a blog post - This will allow authenticated users of the site to create
  new blog posts and upload them to our site
- Update a blog post - This will allow authenticated users who created a post
  the ability to update their posts
- Delete a blog post - this will allow authenticated users the ability to delete
  a blog post

This represents a fairly standard set of endpoints that will allow give us
_most_ of the basic functionality our blog will need in order to work.

## Amazon Aurora

For the purposes of this tutorial series, we'll be creating an Amazon Aurora DB
instance which will be MySQL 5.6 compatible. This will cost roughly \$30/month
to run in a single-node configuration.

Now, the "lower" cost option for spinning up a database could be to run an EC2
t2.micro instance and run MySQL on top of that. However, you then have to worry
about things such as resiliency, automatic failover, monitoring and more. By
buying into these managed services, we effectively trade our money for
peace-of-mind.

And, whilst the absolute cost of the Amazon Aurora database might be higher than
an MySQL database running atop of an EC2 instance, you have to bear in mind that
you are paying for something that can grow to suit your applications high
demands with no additional time invested on your part.

If our blog happens to go viral for any reason, Amazon Aurora will be able to
handle the massive surge in traffic.

## Creating our RDS Instance

So, let's get started by creating our RDS instance.

## Our Lambda Functions

### Insert Post

### Get Post

### Update Post

### Delete Post

### All Posts - Paginated

## Conclusion
