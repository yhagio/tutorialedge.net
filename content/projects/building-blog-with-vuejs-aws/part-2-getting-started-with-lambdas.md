  In this tutorial, we are going to get up and running with some very simple
  Lambda functions and deploying them using the serverless api.

So, in the last tutorial, we managed to get a simple CI/CD pipeline up and
running so that whenever we commit anything to our github repo, it automatically
builds and deploys these changes to our "production" environment.

In this tutorial, we are going to continue to develop our blog and get started
building up the first of our Lambda functions that we'll need to make our blog
work.

## Our First Lambda Function

We'll start by creating a `hello world` style lambda function that will later
return a paginated list of blog posts. Once we've managed to successfully deploy
this version 1 of the endpoint, we can then start working on integrating it with
our DynamoDB table that we'll be creating later on in the series.

```js
const AWS = require("aws-sdk");

module.exports.index = (event, context, callback) => {
  callback(null, {
    statusCode: 200,
    headers: {
      "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello World" })
  });
};
```

Let's break down the above code.

- **line 1** - We import the `aws-sdk` so that we can interact with DynamoDB
  later on
- **line 3** - We define the the entry point of our Lambda function, this
  function takes in the following:
  - **event** - Allows us to access the event data
  - **context** - The context under which the Lambda will execute, this includes
    things like the runtime information.
  - **callback** - The callback we will call when our function is ready to
    return
- **line 5** - We call our `callback` function which returns a `statusCode`, any
  response `headers` and a `body`.

## Serverless Config

Now that we have a simple Lambda function, let's attempt to deploy this using
the serverless command line interface. Create a new `serverless.yml` file within
a new `functions/` directory in the root of your project. You will then want to
populate it with the following `yaml` configuration:

```yaml
service: vuejs-blog-aws

frameworkVersion: ">=1.1.0 <2.0.0"

provider:
  name: aws
  region: eu-west-1

functions:
  list:
    runtime: nodejs8.10
    handler: listPosts.index
    events:
      - http:
          path: posts
          method: get
          cors: true
```

Let's break this configuration down so that we know what's going on:

- **line 1** - We define the name of the service that we will be deploying, in
  this case `vuejs-blow-aws`
- **line 3** - We pin the serverless cli version we wish to use
- **line 5** - We specify that we want to deploy to AWS and the `eu-west-1`
  region within AWS
- **line 9** - We specify what the array of functions we wish to deploy, the
  first of which is our `list` function
- **line 11** - This is the runtime we wish our Lambda function to execute
  within
- **line 12** - This is the handler of our function, this is a combination of
  `listPosts.js` and the `index` function that we defined within said file
- **line 13** - We define how this Lambda is triggered, in this case through
  `http` and through a `GET` request

Now that we've got this all set up for us, we can now deploy our lambda by doing
the following:

```s
$ cd functions/
$ serverless deploy
```

This will then package everything up for us, and handle the deployment of our
functions up to AWS. It will also set up any API Gateways required in order to
interact with our Lambda functions. Upon running this, you should see something
like this:

```s
➜  functions git:(master) ✗ serverless deploy
Serverless: Packaging service...
Serverless: Excluding development dependencies...
Serverless: Uploading CloudFormation file to S3...
Serverless: Uploading artifacts...
Serverless: Uploading service .zip file to S3 (342 B)...
Serverless: Validating template...
Serverless: Updating Stack...
Serverless: Checking Stack update progress...
..........
Serverless: Stack update finished...
Service Information
service: vuejs-blog-aws
stage: dev
region: eu-west-1
stack: vuejs-blog-aws-dev
api keys:
  None
endpoints:
  GET - https://xravpvj33l.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/posts
functions:
  search: vuejs-blog-aws-dev-search
```

You should notice that in the list of `endpoints` this deployment returns, we
have a `GET` request and the url for that request. If we now hit that API
endpoint, we should be able to see `Hello World` displaying within our browser!

## Debugging your Lambda Functions

If you see any issues with this endpoint, it's worthwhile looking into how you
can accurately debug what has gone wrong with the code you have written and
deployed. In order to do that, we need to look at AWS CloudWatch which hosts all
of the logs of our Lambda functions with no additional setup needed. In order to
view these logs, you can either navigate to CloudWatch directly, or you can open
up the Lambda console and select your newly deployed function, you can then
click the `monitoring` tab at the top of the page and it will show you graphs
that tell you things like invocation count, duration and any errors.

You should notice on each of these graph boxes, there is a link to
`Jump to Logs` at the top right. If you click on this, you will be taken to the
CloudWatch logs and you can dive in and see things like stack traces if things
have gone wrong:

## Next Steps

We have now managed to write and deploy our first Lambda function! In the next
few tutorials, we will be expanding our Lambda collection and start integrating
with services such as DynamoDB and eventually GraphQL.

One question you may be asking is `Why Serverless?`. Well, this one function
we've deployed in this tutorial is highly scalable, incredibly resilient and
ready for production. If you are interested, you should check out my article on

production systems.
