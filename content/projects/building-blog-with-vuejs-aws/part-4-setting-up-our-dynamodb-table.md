In the previous tutorial, we managed to get our first Lambda tutorial up and
running, however, it doesn't do anything too exciting as it stands. This is
where Dynamo comes in, we need to create a DynamoDB table where we can store
everything we need for our blog. This includes new blog posts, any comments,
ratings, and whatever else we can think of!

Once we have this new table all defined, we can start to play about with
inserting things and then retrieving them using our existing Lambda function.
Let's get started!

## Step 1 - Creating a DynamoDB Table

The first thing we'll have to do is set up our table. This involves defining a
simple schema that will be used to store our blog posts and subsequently our
comments. We have a number of methods we can use when it comes to defining our
table, we can do it either programmatically or via the web interface. For the
purpose of this tutorial, we'll be using the web interface.

We want our table to be able to store the post's title, the body, a description,
and finally a slug which will allow us to navigate to the page within our Vue.JS
application.

The good thing about a NoSQL database is that we can dynamically change the
schema to suit our needs further down the line, as this is the case, let's just
start by defining our `aws-vuejs-blog-posts` table with our `slug` as the
Primary key and `posted` as our sort key.

By doing this, we allow ourselves incredibly quick lookups of individual blog
posts based off the `slug` we provide and we can also filter.

This will then go ahead and create our table for us. Once this is done we can
then start playing with it and putting in some of our blog's content.

If we want to do cool things such as paginated queries and

## Step 2 - Testing Inserts Locally

Now that we have defined our table's schema and everything is set up for us, we
can go about testing it out with a few simple inserts. For the purpose of this
tutorial, we'll just be using the web interface to insert new content into our
table.

Try inserting a few items into our new table that feature a `title`, a `body`, a
`description`, and a `slug`.

## Step 3 - Updating our Lambda Function

Perfect, we now have both a table and some data within said table to play about
with and retrieve within our solitary Lambda function. Open up your
`listPosts.js` lambda function within your editor and then append the following:
