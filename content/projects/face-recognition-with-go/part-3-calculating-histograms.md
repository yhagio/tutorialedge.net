In the previous part of this series, we looked at how you could calculate the
local binary patterns of a given image. In this part of the course, we'll be
looking at how you can take these calculated local binary patterns and generate
a histogram.

## Test Cases

```go
package histogram

func TestHistogram(t *testing.T) {

}
```

## Implementing the Code

```go
package histogram

func Histogram() {

}
```
