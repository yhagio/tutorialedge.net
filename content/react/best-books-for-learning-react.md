React is without a doubt one of the most popular frontend programming frameworks out at the moment. It features an absolutely incredible online community and a massive range of books and learning resources from which you can learn how to build your own production-ready applications using the framework.

In this list, we will attempt to filter out some of the top books you can purchase if you wish to learn React for your own projects.

# Fullstack React

<p><img src="https://images.tutorialedge.net/books/fullstack-react.png" alt="best books for learning react" class="book-img" />
<b>Fullstack React</b> was sent to me by one of the co-authors - Nate Murray and over the past few weeks I have been working my way through it. 
</p>

At a price tag of $39 for just the book, or $79 for the advanced bundle which includes the source code, videos and sample app, this is very good value for money as it covers just about everything a developer would need to build production-worthy apps in React.

## What it Covers

- Creating your first apps
- How to write your own components
- Handling user interaction
- Managing rich forms
- Interacting with backend APIs
