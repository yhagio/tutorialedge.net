If you are familiar with Unity 4, you may know that the default shader provided
by it was based on a lighting model called the Lambertian reflectance. This
article shows you how you can create a shader with a custom lighting model and
explains the mathematics involved along with the implementation. The following
diagram shows the same geometry rendered with a standard shader (right) and a
diffuse Lambert one (left):

Shaders based on the Lambertian reflectance are classified as
non-photorealistic; no object in the real world looks like this. However,
Lambert Shaders are often used in low-poly games as they produce a neat contrast
between the faces of complex geometries. The lighting model used to calculate
the Lambertian reflectance is also very efficient, making it perfect for mobile
games.

The Lambertian lighting model provided by Unity is one of the more basic and
efficient forms, which you can find in a lot of games even today. As it is
already built into the Unity Surface Shader language, it is best to start with
this first and build on it.

## Create a new shader

Start by carrying out the following steps:

1. Create a new shader and give it a name (`SimpleLambert`).
1. Create a new material, give it a name (`SimpleLambertMat`), and assign the
   new shader to its `shader` property.
1. Then, create a sphere object, place it roughly in the center of the scene,
   and attach the new material to it.
1. Finally, create a directional light to cast some light on your object if one
   isn't created already.
1. When your assets have been set up in Unity, you should have a scene that
   resembles the following screenshot:

Achieving the Lambertian Reflectance The Lambertian reflectance can
be achieved with the following changes to the shader: Begin by replacing the
shader's Properties block with the following :

```c#
Properties
{
  _MainTex("Texture", 2D) = "white"
}
```

Since you are removing all of the other properties, remove
the `_Glossiness`, `_Metallic`, and `_Color` declarations inside
the SubShader section.

Change the #pragma directive of the shader so that it uses your custom lighting
model instead of Standard:

```c
#pragma surface surf SimpleLambert
```

If you try to run the script now, it will complain that it doesn't know what
the SimpleLambert lighting model is. You need to create a function
called Lighting + the name that you gave here, with instructions on how to light
the object, which you’ll learn later in this article. In this case, it would
be LightingSimpleLambert.

Use a very simple surface function, which just samples the texture according to
its UV data:

```c
void surf(Input IN, inout SurfaceOutput o) {
  o.Albedo = tex2D(_MainTex, IN.uv_MainTex).rgb;
}
```

Add a function called LightingSimpleLambert() that will contain the following
code for the Lambertian reflectance:

```c
// Allows us to use the SimpleLambert lighting mode
half4 LightingSimpleLambert (SurfaceOutput s, half3 lightDir,
                             half atten)
{
  // First calculate the dot product of the light direction and the
  // surface's normal
  half NdotL = dot(s.Normal, lightDir);

  // Next, set what color should be returned
  half4 color;

  color.rgb = s.Albedo * _LightColor0.rgb * (NdotL * atten);
  color.a = s.Alpha;

  // Return the calculated color
  return color;
}
```

Save your script and return to the Unity editor. You should notice that it looks
somewhat different than what it was before:

The effect is even easier to see if you use cylinders:

## How it works...

SimpleLambert forces Cg to look for a function called `LightingSimpleLambert()`.
Note the Lighting at the beginning, which is omitted in the directive.

The Lighting function takes three parameters: the surface output (which contains
physical properties such as the albedo and transparency), the direction the
light is coming from, and its attenuation.

According to the Lambertian reflectance, the amount of light a surface reflects
depends on the angle between the incident light and the surface normal. If you
have played pool or billiards, you may surely be familiar with this concept; the
direction of a ball depends on its incident angle against the wall.

If you hit a wall at a 90-degree angle, the ball will come back at you; if you
hit it with a very low angle, its direction will be mostly unchanged. The
Lambertian model makes the same assumption; if the light hits a triangle at a
90-degree angle, all the light gets reflected back. The lower the angle, the
less light is reflected back to you. This concept is shown in the following
diagram:

![](https://images.tutorialedge.net/images/gamedev/unity/custom-diffuse-lighting-tutorial/image5-25.png)

This simple concept has to be translated into a mathematical form. In vector
algebra, the angle between two unit vectors can be calculated via
an operator called dot product. When the dot product is equal to zero, two
vectors are orthogonal, which means that they make a 90-degree angle. When it is
equal to one (or minus one), they are parallel to each other. Cg has a function
called dot(), which implements the dot product extremely efficiently.

The following diagram shows a light source (sun) shining on a complex
surface. L indicates the light direction (called `lightDir` in the shader) and N
is normal to the surface. The light is reflected with the same angle with which
it hits the surface:

![](https://images.tutorialedge.net/images/gamedev/unity/custom-diffuse-lighting-tutorial/image6-27.png)

The Lambertian reflectance simply uses the `NdotL` dot product as a
multiplicative coefficient for the intensity of light:

![](https://images.tutorialedge.net/images/gamedev/unity/custom-diffuse-lighting-tutorial/image7-29.png)

When `N` and `L` are parallel, all the light is reflected back to the source,
causing the geometry to appear brighter. The `_LightColor0` variable contains
the color of the light that is calculated.

Prior to Unity 5, the intensity of the lights was different. If you are using an
old diffuse shader based on the Lambertian model, you may notice that `NdotL` is
multiplied by two: `(NdotL * atten * 2)`, rather than `(NdotL * atten)`. If you
are importing a custom shader from Unity 4, you will need to correct this
manually. Legacy Shaders, however, have already been designed taking this aspect
into account.

When the dot product is negative, the light comes from the opposite side of the
triangle. This is not a problem for opaque geometries as triangles that are not
facing the camera frontally are culled (discarded) and not rendered.

This basic Lambert is a great starting point when you are prototyping your
shaders. You can get a lot accomplished in terms of writing the core
functionality of the shader while not having to worry about the
basic Lighting functions.

Unity has provided you with a lighting model that has already taken the task of
creating Lambert lighting for you. If you look at the `UnityCG.cginc` file found
in your Unity's installation directory under the Data folder, you will notice
that you have Lambert and `BlinnPhong` lighting models available for use. When
you compile your shader with pragma surface surf Lambert, the shader utilizes
Unity’s implementation of the Lambert Lighting function in
the UnityCG.cginc file so that you don't have to write the code over and over
again.
