ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this challenge, you are tasked with trying to implement a function that checks to see if a set is a sub-set of another set.

We'll be carrying on the flying theme where the function takes in a `slice` of Flights and then checks to see if they exist within another `slice` of flights.

<details><summary>Hint</summary>

There are a number of ways to solve this. You may be able to use the `reflect` package or you may be able to serialize each flight and create a hash of them which you can store in a hash.
