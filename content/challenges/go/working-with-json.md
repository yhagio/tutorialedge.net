ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this Go challenge, you are going to be working with JSON data and implementing a function that takes in a JSON string full of stock quotes and returns the one with the highest dividend return.

<Quiz question"How can we optimize this function so that it is not performing unnecessary calculations?" answer="We can implement all of the above checks to ensure that the function only does what it has to before returning the correct answer" correct="C" A="We can check the length of each string at the start of the function and return false if they differ" B="We can use maps to efficiently lookup perviously encountered characters" C="All of the Above" />
