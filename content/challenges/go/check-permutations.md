ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this Go challenge, you are going to be implementing a function that takes in two `string` values and checks to see if they are permutations of one another.

# Example

If I have 2 strings, "abc" and "cba", when I pass these strings into the function, it should return `true` as these two strings are permutations of each other. 


<details><summary>Hints</summary>

> You can iterate through all the characters in a string using the `range` keyword in a for loop

```go
// prints out the position and the rune
for pos, char := range str1 {
  fmt.Printf("%d: %c\n", pos, char)
}
```

Start off by building up a map of these `rune` values to the number of occurrences in one for loop and then work from there.

<Quiz question="How can we optimize this function so that it is not performing unnecessary calculations?" answer="We can implement all of the above checks to ensure that the function only does what it has to before returning the correct answer" correct="C" A="We can check the length of each string at the start of the function and return false if they differ" B="We can use maps to efficiently lookup perviously encountered characters" C="All of the Above" />
