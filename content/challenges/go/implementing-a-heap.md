👋 Welcome Gophers! In this challenge, we will once again be testing our knowledge of data structures and how we can implement them in Go!

In order to complete this challenge, you will have to successfully implement some of the core functionality of the `heap` data structure.

# What is a Heap?

In computer science, a `heap` is a complete binary tree. There are two variations of heaps:

* `Min-Heap` - The root element of this binary tree is the smallest element. 
* `Max-Heap` -
