I am a huge believer in learning through doing, which is one of the main reasons that I have been building up this series of Go challenges to help you learn the language and become proficient in writing and contributing to your own Go projects.

These challenges have been designed and created to gradually build up your knowledge of Go. Each challenge will ultimately cover more and more advanced concepts within the Go programming language and help you to master the basics of the language so that you can go forth and write your own beautiful Go code.
