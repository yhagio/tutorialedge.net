In this challenge, we are going to become familiar with the concept of `Type Assertions` in Go! 

# Preface

If you are new to the language, then type assertions are a concept that can sometimes trip you up and appear a little tricky at first, but after overcoming the syntax it becomes far easier to understand.

Through using type assertions, we can retrieve the *dynamic value* of an interface. For example:

```go
var myName interface{} = "Elliot"

name := myName.(string)
fmt.Println(name)
```

In this example, we have an interface which has a *dynamic value* of "Elliot". We can then use a *type assertion* to retrieve this dynamic value and use the value just like we would any other `string` value in Go.

# Challenge

In this challenge, we are going to define a function that is called `GetDeveloper` which will take in 2 `interface{}` arguments. 

Within this function, you will have to declare a new `Developer` instance and use *type assertion* to populate the values correctly before then returning this new `Developer` instance.
