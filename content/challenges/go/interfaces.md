In this challenge, you are going to implement the necessary methods needed to satisfy the provided Go interface.

On the left hand screen, you have a simple Go application that features an interface called `Employee`. 

In order to complete this challenge, you will have to complete the code and satisfy this interface.

<Quiz question="Can you implement additional methods for this interface outside of the contract?" correct="A" answer="True" A="True" B="False"></Quiz>
