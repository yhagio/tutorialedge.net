In order to understand the min-max algorithm, you should get familiar with game
playing and game trees. Game playing can be classified as game trees. What is a
game tree? A tree is made of a **root** node, and a root node has child nodes;
each child node is subdivided into multiple children.

This forms a tree, and the terminal nodes are termed **leaves**, as shown in
the following diagram:

In game play, our main goal is to win the game; in other words, we try to find
the best possible solution by looking ahead in the game tree. The most important
thing to note about playing a game is that we don't actually go down to a
particular node (or down to a complete tree), and we don't play the entire game.
We are at the root position, and we are looking for the best option that is
available to us, in order to maximize our chances of winning the game.

Since we are performing game playing, we will take turns, just like in a game of
chess or tic-tac-toe; we take a turn, and then our opponent takes a turn. This
means that all of our children, or the children of a particular node, will be
our opponent's move. Our opponent's objective will be to make us lose, because
whatever the game tree that we are going to develop would be in our perspective.
Therefore, from our perspective, on any particular move, our objective is to win
the game; once our move is done, it will be our opponent's move. The opponent's
move, in our perspective, will be to make us lose. Therefore, when looking
ahead, we simply search the game tree.

Consider a tree with the following types of nodes:

- min nodes: These are our opponent's nodes
- max nodes: These are our nodes

In min nodes, we select the minimum cost successor. Out of all of
the successors that we have for a particular node, we choose the minimum. In
a max node, we try to find out the maximum successor, because the nodes are our
moves.

Now, we are not actually moving to a particular point; we are
only looking ahead, performing certain computations in the memory, and trying to
find the best move possible. The terminal nodes are the winning or losing nodes,
but it is often not feasible to search the terminal nodes; so, we apply
heuristics to compare the non-terminal nodes. The following diagram illustrates
our game tree:

We'll start at the root node, A. We have two options: either the right subtree
or the left subtree. If we select either of the subtrees at random, our chances
of losing the game become higher. To avoid this, we will apply certain
heuristics, so that our chances of winning the game will increase. Therefore,
we'll try to model the game. Suppose we select B; our opponent will have the
option to select either D or E. If our opponent selects D, we'll have the option
to select either Hor I. If our opponent chooses H, we will have the option to
select either 10 or 11, this is the maximum that can be performed. Our computer
system does not have the RAM to process any further; therefore, from this point,
we'll apply heuristics.

In the preceding diagram, the heuristic values of all of the terminal nodes can
be seen. The game is not ending, and we are only looking ahead. The heuristic
values comprise the maximum depth that we can go for a look ahead; after them,
we will apply heuristics. The chances of winning the game at particular points
are, let's say, 10%, 11%, 9%, and so on. These are the terminal values that we
have.

Now, suppose that our opponent selects the H node. This is a min node, and a min
node will always choose a minimum out of its successors. Therefore, the min node
will always choose 10, if choosing between 10 and 11. If we move ahead, we
have 9 and 11; so, our opponent will select 9. Similarly, our opponent will
select the rest of the nodes.

Now, it's our move. D, E, F, and G are the max nodes. The max nodes will always
choose the maximum value out of their successors. Therefore, we will
choose 10, 14, 2, and 20 as our nodes. Now it's our opponent's move again, and
our opponent will always choose the minimum among his successors. This time, he
will select 10 and 2. Finally, it is our turn, and we have a max node. We will
choose the maximum value successor: 10. This is illustrated in the following
diagram:

So, this is how the game play works.

## Implementing an example min-max algorithm

In this section, we will be implementing a min-max algorithm (a tic-tac-toe
example). So, let's get to NetBeans. We will have an ArrayList, and we will
apply randomization and take input. The following are the four classes that
we'll be working with:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;
```

Then, we have to define the x and y points. In a tic-tac-toe game, there are
nine tiles, and, on a one-on-one basis with the opponent, the squares are
filled, as shown here:

```java
class Point {

    int x, y;

    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "[" + x + ", " + y + "]";
    }
}

class PointAndScore {

    int score;
    Point point;

    PointAndScore(int score, Point point) {
        this.score = score;
        this.point = point;
    }
}
```

So, we'll define Point, and the x and y points. This will give us
the x and y values, onto which we have to enter the values. String will return
us those values. PointAndScore will provide the point value and its score at
each particular square, whether it is filled in or not.

The Board class will define the entire nine tiles and will take input; this will
give us three states. Either X has won, or the person who has an X has won, or
the person who has a 0 has won, and the available states, if the available
states are Empty:

```java
class Board {

    List<Point> availablePoints;
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    int[][] board = new int[3][3];

    public Board() {
    }

    public boolean isGameOver() {
        return (hasXWon() || hasOWon() || getAvailableStates().isEmpty());
    }

    public boolean hasXWon() {
        if ((board[0][0] == board[1][1] && board[0][0] == board[2][2] && board[0][0] == 1) || (board[0][2] == board[1][1] && board[0][2] == board[2][0] && board[0][2] == 1)) {
            return true;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
            if (((board[i][0] == board[i][1] && board[i][0] == board[i][2] && board[i][0] == 1)
                    || (board[0][i] == board[1][i] && board[0][i] == board[2][i] && board[0][i] == 1))) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    public boolean hasOWon() {
        if ((board[0][0] == board[1][1] && board[0][0] == board[2][2] && board[0][0] == 2) || (board[0][2] == board[1][1] && board[0][2] == board[2][0] && board[0][2] == 2)) {
            return true;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
            if ((board[i][0] == board[i][1] && board[i][0] == board[i][2] && board[i][0] == 2)
                    || (board[0][i] == board[1][i] && board[0][i] == board[2][i] && board[0][i] == 2)) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    public List<Point> getAvailableStates() {
        availablePoints = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == 0) {
                    availablePoints.add(new Point(i, j));
                }
            }
        }
        return availablePoints;
    }

    public void placeAMove(Point point, int player) {
        board[point.x][point.y] = player; //player = 1 for X, 2 for O
    }

    void takeHumanInput() {
        System.out.println("Your move: ");
        int x = scan.nextInt();
        int y = scan.nextInt();
        Point point = new Point(x, y);
        placeAMove(point, 2);
    }

    public void displayBoard() {
        System.out.println();

        for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j) {
                System.out.print(board[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();

        }
    }

    Point computersMove;

    public int minimax(int depth, int turn) {
        if (hasXWon()) return +1;
        if (hasOWon()) return -1;

        List<Point> pointsAvailable = getAvailableStates();
        if (pointsAvailable.isEmpty()) return 0;

        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE, max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int i = 0; i < pointsAvailable.size(); ++i) {
            Point point = pointsAvailable.get(i);
            if (turn == 1) {
                placeAMove(point, 1);
                int currentScore = minimax(depth + 1, 2);
                max = Math.max(currentScore, max);

                if(depth == 0)System.out.println("Score for position "+(i+1)+" = "+currentScore);
                if(currentScore >= 0){ if(depth == 0) computersMove = point;}
                if(currentScore == 1){board[point.x][point.y] = 0; break;}
                if(i == pointsAvailable.size()-1 && max < 0){if(depth == 0)computersMove = point;}
            } else if (turn == 2) {
                placeAMove(point, 2);
                int currentScore = minimax(depth + 1, 1);
                min = Math.min(currentScore, min);
                if(min == -1){board[point.x][point.y] = 0; break;}
            }
            board[point.x][point.y] = 0; //Reset this point
        }
        return turn == 1?max:min;
    }
}
```

If X has won, we have to check which values are equal, such as board [0][0] is
equal to [1][1] and [0][0] is equal to [2][2]. This means that the diagonals are
equal, or [0][0] is equal to 1, or board 0is equal to [1][1]. Either we have all
of the diagonals, or we have any one of the horizontal lines, or we have all
three squares in a vertical line. If this happens, we will return true;
otherwise, we'll check the other values on the board. The following part of the
code will check the values, and will return false if they do not comply with the
preceding conditions:

```java
public boolean hasXWon() {
    if ((board[0][0] == board[1][1] && board[0][0] == board[2][2] && board[0][0] == 1) || (board[0][2] == board[1][1] && board[0][2] == board[2][0] && board[0][2] == 1)) {
        return true;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        if (((board[i][0] == board[i][1] && board[i][0] == board[i][2] && board[i][0] == 1)
                    || (board[0][i] == board[1][i] && board[0][i] == board[2][i] && board[0][i] == 1))) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

Next, we will see whether 0 has won; so, we will do the same thing for 0. Here,
we will check whether the value is 2. Then, if nobody has won, we'll check the
available states for the users, and we'll print them. We will then
have placeAMove, and either player 1 will move or player 2 will move.

Next, we have takeHumanInput; so, we'll take the human input for
the x and y points, and we will display the board using the displayBoard method;
finally, we'll apply a min-max algorithm. So, we'll check if X has won or
if 0 has won; if not, we'll start playing the game, and we will print the score
positions. Finally, in the mainclass, we'll start with who will make the first
move (either the computer or the user). If our user starts a move, we have to
provide the values in x and y coordinates (in an x and y plane); otherwise, the
computer will start the move, and every time, we will have to check
whether X has won. If X has won, we will print Unfortunately, you lost! if 0 has
won, we will print You won! if both win, then we will print It's a draw!

Run the program to get the following output:

The preceding output is the initial position of the port. This has been printed
at the initial point. Now, we have to select our turn. Suppose that we enter 1;
we will get the following output:

The computer's turn was first, and the computer placed the position at [0][0].
Now, it's our move; so, we place [0][2]. This will enter 2 in the last position
on our board, as shown in the following screenshot:

Our 2 has been placed at [0][2]. The preceding screenshot shows our current
positions. The computer has placed a mark on [1][0]. Let's place a mark
on [2][0], as follows:

We now have a position over [2][0] and have blocked the computer. Now,
the computer has entered 1 at [1][1]. Let's put a mark on [1][2], and block the
computer again:

The computer has entered 1 at [2][2], and has won the game. If you enjoyed
