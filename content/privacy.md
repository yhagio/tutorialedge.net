## Privacy Policy of tutorialedge.net

This Application collects some Personal Data from its Users.

Personal Data collected for the following purposes and using the following services:

### Registration and authentication

> **Elliot -** Being a small operation, I very much dislike the thought of having to stress about losing people's personal data and take security incredibly seriously. I delegate authentication to Auth0 which provides a user id - `auth0|12345`.
> I tie everything against this anonymous user ID in the TutorialEdge database. Comments, challenges completed, and code snippets are all saved with this anonymous ID as a foreign key. This allows the handling your requests to pull only the information pertinent to you back. 

> **Note** If you notice any critical issues, please reach out to me immediately - elliot 'at' elliotforbes.co.uk and let me know. Any issues brought forward that are deemed serious will be awarded $50 for their help!

#### Auth0

Personal Data: Cookies; email address; first name; last name; password; picture; various types of Data as specified in the privacy policy of the service

> Auth0's official privacy policy can be found here: [Auth0 Privacy Policy](https://auth0.com/privacy)

#### Stripe

The site uses Stripe in order to process payments for the monthly and yearly subscriptions. 

> Stripe's official privacy policy can be found here: [Stripe Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/gb/privacy)
