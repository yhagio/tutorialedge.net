In this tutorial I’m going to be demonstrating how to build a twitter bot using
[go-twitter](https://github.com/dghubble/go-twitter), a popular Go
client library for the Twitter API.

I’ll be demonstrating how you can build a go based twitter bot that will be able
to do such things as automatically reply to tweets and favorite tweets that
contain a specific hashtag.

## Setting Up Your Project

> **Note -** We'll be using go modules which is an experimental feature of Go
> 1.11

Before we can get started, we'll need to create a new project directory and
initialize it using modules:

```s
$ mkdir -p go-twitter-bot
$ go mod init github.com/elliotforbes/go-twitter-bot
```

This should create a `go.mod` file within our directory and we should be good to
get started writing our twitter bot!

## Connecting to Twitter

Just like with the [Python version of this tutorial](/python/creating-twitter-bot-python/), you’ll have to create an app in twitter’s [app control panel](https://apps.twitter.com/). Once you’ve created a new application, it should present you with all the secret tokens and keys that you need in order to proceed.

## Environment Variables

So, once we've created a new application within the twitter apps dashboard,
we'll have our credentials and we'll be ready to start coding up our app.

We **never** want to hard-code credentials into our application's source code in
case we accidentally commit these credentials into github or somewhere public.
Instead, we'll want to set these as environment variables on our local machine
and retrieve the credentials from there.

We can export these environment variables like so on MacOS:

```s
$ export CONSUMER_KEY=VALUE
$ export CONSUMER_SECRET=VALUE
$ export ACCESS_TOKEN=VALUE
$ export ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=VALUE
```

> **Note -** If you are developing this on Windows, replace the `export` command
> with `set` and this should still work

Once we've done this, we'll be able to pick these values up safely within our
code using the `os` package.

## Writing our Basic Go Twitter Bot

Once you’ve got all the access tokens and secret tokens ready, it’s time to
start implementing our Bot.

Let's start off the process by creating a really simple `main.go` file within
our working directory:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```

And, just to sanity check that everything is working, let's try and run this by
calling `go run`:

```s
$ go run ./...
Hello World
```

Awesome, now that we've got our foundation sorted, let's start building up the
rest of our Bot.

The first thing we'll need, is a way to communicate with the twitter API in such
a way that it knows who we are. We can create a simple `struct` called
`Credentials` which will store our consumer and access tokens for authentication
later on.

```go
import (
    // other imports
    "github.com/dghubble/go-twitter/twitter"
    "github.com/dghubble/oauth1"
)

// Credentials stores all of our access/consumer tokens
// and secret keys needed for authentication against
// the twitter REST API.
type Credentials struct {
    ConsumerKey       string
    ConsumerSecret    string
    AccessToken       string
    AccessTokenSecret string
}

// getClient is a helper function that will return a twitter client
// that we can subsequently use to send tweets, or to stream new tweets
// this will take in a pointer to a Credential struct which will contain
// everything needed to authenticate and return a pointer to a twitter Client
// or an error
func getClient(creds *Credentials) (*twitter.Client, error) {
    // Pass in your consumer key (API Key) and your Consumer Secret (API Secret)
    config := oauth1.NewConfig(creds.ConsumerKey, creds.ConsumerSecret)
    // Pass in your Access Token and your Access Token Secret
    token := oauth1.NewToken(creds.AccessToken, creds.AccessTokenSecret)

    httpClient := config.Client(oauth1.NoContext, token)
    client := twitter.NewClient(httpClient)

    // Verify Credentials
    verifyParams := &twitter.AccountVerifyParams{
        SkipStatus:   twitter.Bool(true),
        IncludeEmail: twitter.Bool(true),
    }

    // we can retrieve the user and verify if the credentials
    // we have used successfully allow us to log in!
    user, _, err := client.Accounts.VerifyCredentials(verifyParams)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    log.Printf("User's ACCOUNT:\n%+v\n", user)
    return client, nil
}

```

Perfect, we now have a means of connecting to the twitter API and validating
whether the credentials we have used have worked.

We'll want to update our `main()` function to create a `Credentials` struct and
retrieve a new client for us using our newly implemented function:

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Go-Twitter Bot v0.01")
    creds := Credentials{
        AccessToken:       os.Getenv("ACCESS_TOKEN"),
        AccessTokenSecret: os.Getenv("ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"),
        ConsumerKey:       os.Getenv("CONSUMER_KEY"),
        ConsumerSecret:    os.Getenv("CONSUMER_SECRET"),
    }

    fmt.Printf("%+v\n", creds)

    client, err := getClient(&creds)
    if err != nil {
        log.Println("Error getting Twitter Client")
        log.Println(err)
    }

    // Print out the pointer to our client
    // for now so it doesn't throw errors
    fmt.Printf("%+v\n", client)

}
```

We should now be able to run this using the same `go run ./...` command that we
used earlier. If our credentials have been set properly, we should see our
account details being printed out in the client!

## Sending Tweets

Ok, so now that we've got a client that works, we can try sending a few test
tweets out using one of the libraries' existing functions.

Remove the final `fmt.Printf()` statement in your `main()` function and let's
try sending a simple tweet:

```go
tweet, resp, err := client.Statuses.Update("A Test Tweet from a new Bot I'm building!", nil)
if err != nil {
    log.Println(err)
}
log.Printf("%+v\n", resp)
log.Printf("%+v\n", tweet)
```

And, if everything goes to plan, we should see that a new tweet from our account
has popped up on our timelines:

## Searching Tweets

Ok, so we're able to send tweets, but how do we go about searching for tweets on
a given topic?

To do that we could search for tweets using this handy function:

```go
search, resp, err := client.Search.Tweets(&twitter.SearchTweetParams{
    Query: "Golang",
})

if err != nil {
    log.Print(err)
}

log.Printf("%+v\n", resp)
log.Printf("%+v\n", search)
```

And when we run this, we should be able to see a list of tweets that have
`Golang` mentioned somewhere within them!

Now, imagine we swapped this out for `Google`, or `Amazon` or any other major
brand and plugged in a sentiment analysis system. We could chart things like the
general sentiment for a brand across twitter over time, which would be pretty
awesome!

## Conclusion

That's us reached the end of our journey for this particular topic! I'm hoping
this tutorial has given you a good enough foundation to go off and build really
cool systems that interact with various social media accounts.
