In this tutorial, we are going to be looking at closures in Go. We'll be
covering the theory behind them, and we'll look at how you can use them in your
own Go applications.

## Closures - The Theory

So, let's dive in the theory.

We can create and use closures within any programming language that supports
functions as first-class object. Go, just so happens to be one such language,
otherwise this article would be pointless.

So, the technical definition for a closure is
`a closure is a technique for implementing a lexically scoped name binding in a language with first-class functions - Wikipedia`.

Now, don't worry, when I first read this I scratched my head a little and had to
think things through.

In layman's terms, a closure is a function value which is able to reference
variables that lay outwith it's body.

## A Simple Example

Let's create a really simple example of a closure which will hopefully clarify
how it works.

We'll start by creating a really simple function called `getLimit()` which will
be our closure in this example.

This will contain a `limit` variable of type `int` which will be set to `10`.
Every time `limit()` is called

<div class="filename">main.go</div>

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func getLimit() func() int {
    limit := 10
    return func() int {
        limit -= 1
        return limit
    }
}

func main() {
    limit := getLimit()
    fmt.Println(limit())
    fmt.Println(limit())
}

```

Now, if we run this, we should see the following output:

<div class="filename"> $ go run main.go</div>

```s
9
8
```

But why is this important? Well, this `limit` variable is bound to its assigned
`limit`. If we were to bind `getLimit()` to say, `limit2` just below it, it
would have a state that is unique to it:

<div class="filename">main.go</div>

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func getLimit() func() int {
    limit := 10
    return func() int {
        limit -= 1
        return limit
    }
}

func main() {
    limit := getLimit()
    fmt.Println(limit()) // 9
    fmt.Println(limit()) // 8

    limit2 := getLimit()
    fmt.Println(limit2()) // 9
    fmt.Println(limit2()) // 8

    fmt.Println(limit()) // 7

}
```

When we run this, we should see the following output:

<div class="filename"> $ go run main.go</div>

```s
9
8
9
8
7
```

Awesome, so we've just successfully created our own instance of a `closure` in
Go.

## Conclusion

So, in this tutorial, we covered the basic theory of closures and how you can
use them within your own Go programs.

Hopefully, you found this tutorial useful, if you did, or if you have any
feedback/suggestions, I would love to hear them in the comments/suggestions
section below!
