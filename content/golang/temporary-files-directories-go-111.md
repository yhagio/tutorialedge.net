Go 1.11 brought some very cool new functionality such as the experimental Go
Modules feature as well as the ability to create temporary files and directories
using the new `TempFile` and `TempDir` functions within the `ioutil` package.

The temporary files and directories created from these function calls are
globally unique and this is awesome as it simplifies the way we handle hundreds
or even thousands of files within our Go programs.

In this tutorial, we'll be looking at how you can use these within your own Go
programs and some potential use cases.

## Creating Temporary Files

Let's start off by looking at the new `TempFile` function. Let's say we were
creating an object recognition system that pulled in thousands of pictures of
cars and used them as training sets.

For each of the cars we pull in, we'll want to create a temporary file with a
unique name that we don't necessarily care about.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "ioutil"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    // we call ioutil.TempFile which returns either a file
    // or an error.
    // we specify the directory we want to create these temp files in
    // for this example we'll use `car-images`, and we'll define
    // a pattern which will be used for naming our car images
    // in this case car-*.png
    file, err := ioutil.TempFile("car-images", "car-*.png")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
    // We can choose to have these files deleted on program close
    defer os.Remove(file.Name())
    // We can then have a look and see the name
    // of the image that has been generated for us
    fmt.Println(file.Name())
}
```

If we then try to run this in our console, we should see the following output:

```s
$ go run main.go
car-images/car-982382640.png
```

This has automatically replaced the `*` character within our defined `car-*.png`
pattern with a random, globally-unique pattern.

### Writing to Temporary Files

If we want to write to these temporary files, we can do so using the `Write`
function like so:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    // we call ioutil.TempFile which returns either a file
    // or an error.
    // we specify the directory we want to create these temp files in
    // for this example we'll use `car-images`, and we'll define
    // a prefix that will be used for all of our individual image filenames
    // in this case we'll use 'car-'
    file, err := ioutil.TempFile("car-images", "car-*.png")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
    // We can choose to have these files deleted on program close
    defer os.Remove(file.Name())

    if _, err := file.Write([]byte("hello world\n")); err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }

    data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(file.Name())
    // if our program was unable to read the file
    // print out the reason why it can't
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }

    // if it was successful in reading the file then
    // print out the contents as a string
    fmt.Print(string(data))

}
```

This will write `Hello World\n` to our temporary file, and then attempt to read
in the contents of that file using the `ioutil.ReadFile()` function. When we run
this, we should see the following output:

```s
$ go run main.go
hello world
```

## Generating Temporary Directories

Now that we've covered temporary files, let's have a look at generating
temporary directories. This could be useful if we wanted to extend our object
recognition system further and generate directories containing distinct objects
and cars within them.

Let's have a look at a simple, practical example as to how we can use this.
We'll be extending our existing program from above to create a temporary
directory in which our temporary car files will exist:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "os"
)

func main() {

    tempDir, err := ioutil.TempDir("", "cars-")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
    defer os.RemoveAll(tempDir)

    file, err := ioutil.TempFile(tempDir, "car-*.png")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
    defer os.Remove(file.Name())

    // This will print out the full name and path of our image
    fmt.Println(file.Name())

    if _, err := file.Write([]byte("hello world\n")); err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }

    data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(file.Name())
    // if our program was unable to read the file
    // print out the reason why it can't
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }

    // if it was successful in reading the file then
    // print out the contents as a string
    fmt.Print(string(data))

}
```

When we go to run this, we should see our globally unique directory being
created and our globally unique filename appended to the end of that directory:

```s
$ go run main.go
/var/folders/3x/5g0pww953x54mq7rjttr5f880000gn/T/cars-396489778/car-860960233.png
hello world
```

## Conclusion

Awesome, in this tutorial, we looked at how we could use the newly added
`TempDir` and `TempFile` functions from the `io/ioutil` package for fame and
fortune.
