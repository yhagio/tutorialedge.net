The Event-driven programming paradigm is something that I've always thought was
really interesting, and I've used it in the past with RxPy, the Python
equivalent of this particular library we'll be using here.

The main beauty of event driven programs are their simplicity. You can model
events coming in to the system and define subscribers to these events that
trigger and handle them accordingly.

So, in this tutorial we managed to cover how to write event-driven programs in
Go using RxGo.
