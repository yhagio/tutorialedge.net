**In this tutorial, we are going to be looking at how you can use
channels within your Go-based applications.**

Channels are pipes that link between `goroutines` within your Go based
applications that allow communication and subsequently the passing of values to
and from variables.

They are incredibly handy and can help you craft incredibly high performance,
highly concurrent applications in Go with minimal fuss compared to other
programming languages. This was by no means a fluke, when designing the
language, the core developers decided that they wanted concurrency within their
language to be a first class citizen and to make it as simple to work with as
possible, without going too far and not allowing developers the freedom they
need to work in.

The ability to craft concurrent systems so easily is something that drew me to
the language in the first place, and I have to say, it's been an absolute
delight so far.

## Goals

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

* Be able to create simple concurrent Go applications that use channels

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this tutorial, you will need to have met the following 
prerequisites:

* You will need Go installed on your machine.

## The Theory

The idea of channels isn't anything new, as like many of Go's concurrency
features, these concepts have been brought forward from the likes of Hoare's
Communicating Sequential Processes (1978), CSP for short, and even from the
likes of Dijkstra's guarded commands (1975).

The developers of Go, however, have made it their mission to present these
concepts in a simple a fashion as possible to enable programmers to create
better, more correct, highly concurrent applications.

## A Simple Example

Let's start off by seeing how we can build up a really simple example of how
this works in Go. We'll first create a function that goes away and computes an
arbitrary, random value and passes it back to a channel variable called
`values`:

<div class="filename">main.go</div>

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
)

func CalculateValue(values chan int) {
    value := rand.Intn(10)
    fmt.Println("Calculated Random Value: {}", value)
    values <- value
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Go Channel Tutorial")

  values := make(chan int)
  defer close(values)

    go CalculateValue(values)

    value := <-values
    fmt.Println(value)
}

```

Let's disect what happened here. In our `main()` function, we called
`values := make(chan int)`, this call effectively created our new channel so
that we could subsequently use it within our `CalculateValue` goroutine.

> **Note -** We used `make` when instantiating our `values` channel as, like
> maps and slices, channels must be created before use.

After we created out channel, we then called `defer close(values)` which
deferred the closing of our channel until the end of our `main()` function's
execution. This is typically considered best practice to ensure that we tidy up
after ourselves.

After our call to `defer`, we go on to kick off our single goroutine:
`CalculateValue(values)` passing in our newly created `values` channel as its
parameter. Within our `CalculateValue` function, we calculate a single random
value between 1-10, print this out and then send this value to our `values`
channel by calling `values <- value`.

Jumping back into our `main()` function, we then call `value := <-values` which
receives a value from our `values` channel.

> **Note -** Notice how when we execute this program, it doesn't immediately
> terminate. This is because the act of sending to and receiving from a channel
> are blocking. Our `main()` function blocks until it receives a value from our
> channel.

Upon execution of this code, you should see the output look something like this:

```paintext
$ go run main.go
Go Channel Tutorial
Calculated Random Value: {} 7
7
```

> **Summary**:

> `myChannel := make(chan int)` - creates _myChannel_ which is a channel of type
> `int`

> `channel <- value` - sends a value _to_ a channel

> `value := <- channel` - receives a value _from_ a channel

So, instantiating and using channels in your Go programs looks fairly
straightforward so far, but what about in more complex scenarios?

<!-- ## Multiple goroutines Example

Let's now take a look at how we can construct our Go programs to use `channels` in conjunction with a number of different `goroutines` and build up the complexity a bit.  -->

## Unbuffered Channels

Using a traditional `channel` within your goroutines can sometimes lead to
issues with behavior that you may not quite be expecting. With traditional
`unbuffered` channels, whenever one goroutine sends a value to this channel,
that goroutine will subsequently block until the value is received from the
channel.

Let's see this in a real example. If we have a look at the below code, it's very
similar to the code that we had previously. However, we have extended our
`CalculateValue()` function to perform an `fmt.Println` after it has sent it's
randomly calculated value to the channel.

In our `main()` function, we've added a second call to
`go CalculateValue(valueChannel)` so we should expect 2 values sent to this
channel in very quick succession.

<div class="filename">main.go</div>

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
    "time"
)

func CalculateValue(c chan int) {
    value := rand.Intn(10)
    fmt.Println("Calculated Random Value: {}", value)
    time.Sleep(1000 * time.Millisecond)
    c <- value
    fmt.Println("Only Executes after another goroutine performs a receive on the channel")
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Go Channel Tutorial")

    valueChannel := make(chan int)
    defer close(valueChannel)

    go CalculateValue(valueChannel)
    go CalculateValue(valueChannel)

    values := <-valueChannel
    fmt.Println(values)
}
```

However, when you run this, you should see that only our first goroutines' final
print statement is actually executed:

```plaintext
go run main.go
Go Channel Tutorial
Calculated Random Value: {} 1
Calculated Random Value: {} 7
1
Only Executes after another goroutine performs a receive on the channel
```

The reason for this is our call to `c <- value` has blocked in our second
goroutine and subsequently the `main()` function concludes it's execution before
our second `goroutine` gets a chance to complete its own execution.

## Buffered Channels

The way to get around this blocking behavior is to use something called a
buffered channel. These buffered channels are essentially queues of a given size
that can be used for cross-goroutine communication. In order to create a
buffered channel as opposed to an unbuffered channel, we supply a capacity
argument to our `make` command:

```go
bufferedChannel := make(chan int, 3)
```

By changing this to a buffered channel, our send operation, `c <- value` only
blocks within our goroutines should the channel be full.

Let's modify our existing program to use a buffered channel and have a look at
the output. Notice that I've added a call to `time.Sleep()` at the bottom of our
`main()` function in order to lazily block our `main()` function enough to allow
our goroutines to complete execution.

<div class="filename">main.go</div>

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
    "time"
)

func CalculateValue(c chan int) {
    value := rand.Intn(10)
    fmt.Println("Calculated Random Value: {}", value)
    time.Sleep(1000 * time.Millisecond)
    c <- value
    fmt.Println("This executes regardless as the send is now non-blocking")
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Go Channel Tutorial")

    valueChannel := make(chan int, 2)
    defer close(valueChannel)

    go CalculateValue(valueChannel)
    go CalculateValue(valueChannel)

    values := <-valueChannel
    fmt.Println(values)

    time.Sleep(1000 * time.Millisecond)
}
```

Now, when we execute this, we should see that our second goroutine does indeed
continue its execution regardless of the fact a second receive has not been
called in our `main()` function. Thanks to the `time.Sleep()`, we can clearly
see the difference between unbuffered channels and their blocking nature and our
buffered channels and their non-blocking (when not full) nature.

```plaintext
Go Channel Tutorial
Calculated Random Value: {} 1
Calculated Random Value: {} 7
7
This executes regardless as the send is now non-blocking
This executes regardless as the send is now non-blocking
```

## Conclusion

So, in this fairly lengthy tutorial, we managed to learn about the various
distinct types of channels within Go. We discovered the differences between both
buffered and unbuffered channels and how we could use them to our advantage
within our concurrent go programs.
