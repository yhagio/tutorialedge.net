[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TutorialEdge/go-interfaces-tutorial.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/TutorialEdge/go-interfaces-tutorial)

Welcome all, in this tutorial we are going to be taking a look at interfaces
within the Go programming language.

By the end of this tutorial, we'll have covered the following topics:

* The Basics of Interfaces
* Defining Your Own Interfaces

There will be a number of challenges at the end of this tutorial that you are free
to try and complete on your own machine to try and validate some of the topics we have
covered in this tutorial. If you appreciate this method of learning then please
feel free to let me know in the comments section below!

## Basic Example

If you are new to Go, you may be seeing `interface{}` a lot in code snippets and
tutorials. This can be fairly daunting seeing this at first if you don't know
what interfaces are in Go and what they are used for.

Typically, if you see a function or a method that expects an empty interface,
then you can typically pass anything into this function/method.

Let's see an example of this in action:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func myFunc(a interface{}) {
    fmt.Println(a)
}

func main() {
    var my_age int
    my_age = 25

    myFunc(my_age)
}
```

If we then go to run this then we should see that it runs successfully and
prints out our integer value:

```s
$ go run main.go
25
```

### Why is this Useful?

By defining a function that takes in an `interface{}`, we essentially give
ourselves the flexibility to pass in anything we want. It's a Go programmers way
of saying, this function takes in something, but I don't necessarily care about
its type.

## Defining Interfaces

So, what are interfaces? Why do we use them within Go? Well by defining an
interface in Go, we essentially define a contract. If we define a type based off
this `interface` then we are forced to implement all of the functions or methods
defined within that `interface` type.

Say, for example, we wanted to define an interface for a Guitarist. We could
define our interface to include a `PlayGuitar()` function like so:

```go
type Guitarist interface {
  // PlayGuitar prints out "Playing Guitar"
  // to the terminal
  PlayGuitar()
}
```

With our `Guitarist` interface defined, we could define a `BaseGuitarist` and an
`AcousticGuitarist` struct which implements the `Guitarist` interface.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Guitarist interface {
    // PlayGuitar prints out "Playing Guitar"
    // to the terminal
    PlayGuitar()
}

type BaseGuitarist struct {
    Name string
}

type AcousticGuitarist struct {
    Name string
}

func (b BaseGuitarist) PlayGuitar() {
    fmt.Printf("%s plays the Bass Guitar\n", b.Name)
}

func (b AcousticGuitarist) PlayGuitar() {
    fmt.Printf("%s plays the Acoustic Guitar\n", b.Name)
}

func main() {
    var player BaseGuitarist
    player.Name = "Paul"
    player.PlayGuitar()

    var player2 AcousticGuitarist
    player2.Name = "Ringo"
    player2.PlayGuitar()
}
```

Should we wish, we could then create an array of type `Guitarist` which could
store both our `BaseGuitarist` and `AcousticGuitarist` objects.

```go
var guitarists []Guitarist
guitarists = append(guitarists, player)
guitarists = append(guitarists, player2)
```

## Return Values

In real-world examples, we would typically have more complex functions within
our interfaces that featured return values. In Go, we can define these
interfaces like so:

```go
type Employee interface {
    Name() string
    Language() string
    Age() int
    Random() (string, error)
}
```

## Satisfying Interfaces

Say we wanted to create an array of all `Employee`'s in the firm. Within this
array, we'd want all of our `Engineer`s.

Now, in order for this to work, we'd need our `Engineer` type to satisfy the
`Employee` interface or it will not allow us to compile our program:

```go
package main

type Employee interface {
    Language() string
    Age() int
    Random() (string, error)
}

type Engineer struct {
    Name string
}

func (e Engineer) Language() string {
    return e.Name + " programs in Go"
}

func main() {
    // This will throw an error
    var programmers []Employee
    elliot := Engineer{Name: "Elliot"}
    // Engineer does not implement the Employee interface
    // you'll need to implement Age() and Random()
    programmers = append(programmers, elliot)
}
```

## Conclusion

So, within this tutorial, we have successfully managed to uncover what
interfaces are within Go and how we can implement them within our own Go-based
programs.
