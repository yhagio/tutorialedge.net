Welcome all, in this tutorial, we are going to be taking a look at how you can
read in JSON files, or JSON HTTP responses and parse them to your hearts desire.

JSON or Javascript Object Notation as it is short for, is a standard format for
sending and receiving information. We could represent the same information with
either XML or JSON, but JSON provides one advantage in the fact it is far more
compact and in my personal experience, more readable.

JSON is now the most popular data format available and you'll find that most
RESTful APIs provide JSON responses when you try to interface with them. Thus
being able to work with it and parse it in Go is incredibly useful!

## The Encoding/Json Package

So, to get us started, we'll be leveraging the `encoding/json` standard library
package in order to get us up and running. I highly recommend you check out the
official documentation for this here:
[Encoding/Json](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/).

Let's start with a really simple Go program as our base, we'll build this out to
showcase how to work with various different examples. Create a new file called
`main.go`.

<div class="filename">main.go</div>

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```

And we can run this with a simple `go run main.go` call. This should return a
simple `Hello World`.

## Reading and Parsing a JSON File

Let's try and read in a simple JSON file and then parse it. For the purpose of
this tutorial we’ll be parsing the following json within our file. Copy this and
save it into a `users.json` file within the same directory as your `main.go`
file.

<div class="filename">users.json</div>

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "name": "Elliot",
      "type": "Reader",
      "age": 23,
      "social": {
        "facebook": "https://facebook.com",
        "twitter": "https://twitter.com"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Fraser",
      "type": "Author",
      "age": 17,
      "social": {
        "facebook": "https://facebook.com",
        "twitter": "https://twitter.com"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This should be complex enough to test our skills and should allow us to transfer
our skills to real world examples fairly easily.

## Reading the JSON File

We’ll be using the `os` package in order to open up our `users.json` file from
our filesystem. Once we have opened the file, we'll defer the closing of the
file till the end of the function so that we can work with the data inside of
it.

```go
// Open our jsonFile
jsonFile, err := os.Open("users.json")
// if we os.Open returns an error then handle it
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
}
fmt.Println("Successfully Opened users.json")
// defer the closing of our jsonFile so that we can parse it later on
defer jsonFile.Close()
```

### Parsing with Structs

We have a few options when it comes to parsing the JSON that is contained within
our `users.json` file. We could either unmarshal the JSON using a set of
predefined structs, or we could unmarshal the JSON using a
`map[string]interface{}` to parse our JSON into strings mapped against arbitrary
data types.

If you know the structure that you are expecting then I would recommend going
down the verbose route and defining your structs like so:

<div class="filename">main.go</div>

```go
package main

import (
    …
    // import our encoding/json package
    “encoding/json”
    …
)

// Users struct which contains
// an array of users
type Users struct {
    Users []User `json:"users"`
}

// User struct which contains a name
// a type and a list of social links
type User struct {
    Name   string `json:"name"`
    Type   string `json:"type"`
    Age    int    `json:"Age"`
    Social Social `json:"social"`
}

// Social struct which contains a
// list of links
type Social struct {
    Facebook string `json:"facebook"`
    Twitter  string `json:"twitter"`
}
```

Once we have these in place, we can use them to unmarshal our JSON.

## Unmarshalling our JSON

Once we've used the os.Open function to read our file into memory, we then have
to convert it toa byte array using ioutil.ReadAll. Once it's in a byte array we
can pass it to our json.Unmarshal() method.

```go
// read our opened jsonFile as a byte array.
byteValue, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(jsonFile)

// we initialize our Users array
var users Users

// we unmarshal our byteArray which contains our
// jsonFile's content into 'users' which we defined above
json.Unmarshal(byteValue, &users)

// we iterate through every user within our users array and
// print out the user Type, their name, and their facebook url
// as just an example
for i := 0; i < len(users.Users); i++ {
    fmt.Println("User Type: " + users.Users[i].Type)
    fmt.Println("User Age: " + strconv.Itoa(users.Users[i].Age))
    fmt.Println("User Name: " + users.Users[i].Name)
    fmt.Println("Facebook Url: " + users.Users[i].Social.Facebook)
}
```

## Working with Unstructured Data

Sometimes, going through the process of creating structs for everything can be
somewhat time consuming and overly verbose for the problems you are trying to
solve. In this instance, we can use standard `interfaces{}` in order to read in
any JSON data:

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "os"
)

func main() {

    // Open our jsonFile
    jsonFile, err := os.Open("users.json")
    // if we os.Open returns an error then handle it
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
    fmt.Println("Successfully Opened users.json")
    // defer the closing of our jsonFile so that we can parse it later on
    defer jsonFile.Close()

    byteValue, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(jsonFile)

    var result map[string]interface{}
    json.Unmarshal([]byte(byteValue), &result)

    fmt.Println(result["users"])

}

```

You can see in the above code, we've managed to open our `users.json` and parse
the JSON much like we would normally do in other programming languages such as
Python or JavaScript.

When we run this, we should see that printing `result["users"]` results in a
`map` being outputted to the console:

```s
$ go run main.go
Successfully opened users.json
[map[type:Reader age:23 social:map[facebook:https://facebook.com twitter:https://twitter.com] name:Elliot] map[name:Frasertype:Author age:17 social:map[facebook:https://facebook.com twitter:https://twitter.com]]]
```

If we wanted to traverse further down the tree, we could do that just as we
normally would traverse down a `map` structure within Go, without having to
define the struct types.

> **Note -** It is typically recommended to try and define the structs, if you
> happen to know the structure of the data coming back.

## Full Implementation

Below you'll find the full implementation of this tutorial.

<div class="filename">main.go</div>

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "os"
    "strconv"
)

// Users struct which contains
// an array of users
type Users struct {
    Users []User `json:"users"`
}

// User struct which contains a name
// a type and a list of social links
type User struct {
    Name   string `json:"name"`
    Type   string `json:"type"`
    Age    int    `json:"Age"`
    Social Social `json:"social"`
}

// Social struct which contains a
// list of links
type Social struct {
    Facebook string `json:"facebook"`
    Twitter  string `json:"twitter"`
}

func main() {
    // Open our jsonFile
    jsonFile, err := os.Open("users.json")
    // if we os.Open returns an error then handle it
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }

    fmt.Println("Successfully Opened users.json")
    // defer the closing of our jsonFile so that we can parse it later on
    defer jsonFile.Close()

    // read our opened xmlFile as a byte array.
    byteValue, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(jsonFile)

    // we initialize our Users array
    var users Users

    // we unmarshal our byteArray which contains our
    // jsonFile's content into 'users' which we defined above
    json.Unmarshal(byteValue, &users)

    // we iterate through every user within our users array and
    // print out the user Type, their name, and their facebook url
    // as just an example
    for i := 0; i < len(users.Users); i++ {
        fmt.Println("User Type: " + users.Users[i].Type)
        fmt.Println("User Age: " + strconv.Itoa(users.Users[i].Age))
        fmt.Println("User Name: " + users.Users[i].Name)
        fmt.Println("Facebook Url: " + users.Users[i].Social.Facebook)
    }

}
```
