  In this tutorial, we are going to be looking at how you can implement your own
  decorator functions in Go.
---

Decorators are certainly more prominent in other programming languages such as
Python and TypeScript, but that's not to say you can't use them in Go. In fact,
for certain problems, using decorators is the perfect solution as we'll
hopefully be finding out in this tutorial.

## Understanding the Decorator Pattern

> **Decorators** essentially allow you to wrap existing functionality and append
> or prepend your own custom functionality on top.

In Go, functions are deemed as first class objects which essentially means you
can pass them around just as you would a variable. Let's see this in action with
a very simple example:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
)

func myFunc() {
  fmt.Println("Hello World")
  time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}

func main() {
  fmt.Printf("Type: %T\n", myFunc)
}
```

So, in this example, we've defined a function called `myFunc`, which simply
prints out `Hello World`. However, in the body of our `main()` function, we've
called `fmt.Printf` and we've used `%T` to print out the type of the value we
pass in as our second argument. In this case, we are passing `myFunc` which will
subsequently print out the following:

```s
$ go run test.go
Type: func()
```

So, what does this mean for us Go developers then? Well, it highlights the fact
that **functions can be passed around and used as arguments** within other parts
of our code base.

Let's see this in action by extending our codebase a little bit more and adding
a `coolFunc()` function which takes in a function as its only parameter:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
)

func myFunc() {
  fmt.Println("Hello World")
  time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}

// coolFunc takes in a function
// as a parameter
func coolFunc(a func()) {
    // it then immediately calls that functino
  a()
}

func main() {
  fmt.Printf("Type: %T\n", myFunc)
  // here we call our coolFunc function
  // passing in myFunc
    coolFunc(myFunc)
}
```

When we attempt to run this, we should see that our new output features our
`Hello World` string as we'd expect:

```s
$ go run test.go
Type: func()
Hello World
```

Now, this may strike you as a bit odd at first. Why would you want to do
something like this? It essentially adds a layer of abstraction over your call
to `myFunc` and complicates the code without really adding much value.

## A Simple Decorator

Let's see how we could use this pattern to add some value to our codebase. We
could, if we wanted, add some additional logging around the execution of a
particular function just to highlight it's start and end time.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func myFunc() {
  fmt.Println("Hello World")
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}

func coolFunc(a func()) {
    fmt.Printf("Starting function execution: %s\n", time.Now())
    a()
    fmt.Printf("End of function execution: %s\n", time.Now())
}

func main() {
    fmt.Printf("Type: %T\n", myFunc)
    coolFunc(myFunc)
}

```

Upon calling this, you should see logs that look a little like this:

```s
$ go run test.go
Type: func()
Starting function execution: 2018-10-21 11:11:25.011873 +0100 BST m=+0.000443306
Hello World
End of function execution: 2018-10-21 11:11:26.015176 +0100 BST m=+1.003743698
```

As you can see, we've been able to effectively wrap my original function without
having to alter it's implementation. We are now able to clearly see when this
function was started and when it finished execution and it highlights to us that
the function takes just about a second to finish execution.

## Real World Examples

Let's look at a few more examples as to how we can use decorators for further
fame and fortune. We'll take a really simple http web server and decorate our
endpoints so that we can verify whether or not the incoming request has a
particular header set.

> **If you fancy** learning more about writing a simple REST API in Go then I
> recommend checking out my other article here:
> [Creating a REST API in Go](/golang/creating-restful-api-with-golang/)

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"
)

func homePage(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Println("Endpoint Hit: homePage")
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Welcome to the HomePage!")
}

func handleRequests() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", homePage)
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8081", nil))
}

func main() {
    handleRequests()
}
```

As you can see, nothing particularly complex in our code. We set up a `net/http`
router that serves a single `/` endpoint.

Let's add a really simple authentication decorator function that will check to
see if the `Authorized` header is set to `true` on the incoming request.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"
)

func isAuthorized(endpoint func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {

        fmt.Println("Checking to see if Authorized header set...")

        if val, ok := r.Header["Authorized"]; ok {
            fmt.Println(val)
            if val[0] == "true" {
                fmt.Println("Header is set! We can serve content!")
                endpoint(w, r)
            }
        } else {
            fmt.Println("Not Authorized!!")
            fmt.Fprintf(w, "Not Authorized!!")
        }
    })
}

func homePage(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Println("Endpoint Hit: homePage")
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Welcome to the HomePage!")
}

func handleRequests() {

    http.Handle("/", isAuthorized(homePage))
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8081", nil))
}

func main() {
    handleRequests()
}
```

> **Note:** This is absolutely not the right way to handle securing your REST
> API, I'd recommend looking at using JWT or OAuth2 in order to achieve that
> goal!

So, let's break this down and try to understand what's going on!

We've created a new decorator function called `isAuthorized()` which takes in a
function that matches the same signature as our original `homePage` function.
This then returns a `http.Handler`.

Within the body of our `isAuthorized()` function, we return a new
`http.HandlerFunc` within which does the job of validating our `Authorized`
header is set and equals `true`. Now, this is a drastically simplified version
of `OAuth2` authentication/authorization, There's a few slight discrepancies but
it gives you a general idea as to how it would work.

The **key thing to note** however, is the fact that we've managed to decorate an
existing endpoint and add some form of authentication around said endpoint
without having to alter the existing implementation of that function.

Now, if we were to add a new endpoint that we wanted to be protected, we could
easily do so:

```go
// define our newEndpoint function. Notice how, yet again,
// we don't do any authentication based stuff in the body
// of this function
func newEndpoint(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Println("My New Endpoint")
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "My second endpoint")
}

func handleRequests() {

    http.Handle("/", isAuthorized(homePage))
  // register our /new endpoint and decorate our
  // function with our isAuthorized Decorator
  http.Handle("/new", isAuthorized(newEndpoint))
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8081", nil))
}
```

This highlights the key benefits of the decorator pattern, where wrapping code
within our codebase is incredibly simple. We can easily add new authenticated
endpoints using this same method

## Conclusion

Hopefully, this tutorial helped to demystify the wonders of the decorator and
how you can use the decorator pattern within your own Go-based programs. We
learned about the benefits of the decorator pattern and how we could use it to
wrap existing functionality with new functionality.

In the second part of the tutorial, we looked at a more realistic example as to
how you could potentially use this within your own production-level Go systems.
