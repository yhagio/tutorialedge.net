## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to...

1. Encrypt text using the AES - Advanced Encryption Standard in Go
1. We'll then look at writing this encrypted message to a file
1. Finally we'll look at how we can decrypt this message using a shared secret

From this, you should be able to build your own simple encryption systems that
can do various things like, encrypt files on your file system and protect them
with a passphrase only you know or add simple encryption to various parts of the
systems that you are working on.

## Introduction

We'll start off by looking at the AES, or Advanced Encryption Standard, as that
is the standard we will be using to encrypt and decrypt the information within
our Go programs.

Then we'll build up a really simple encryption program which will take in a
passphrase from the command line and use this in conjunction with AES to encrypt
a passage of text.

Once this is done, we'll create a counterpart program which will decrypt this
passage of text using that same passphrase we used to encrypt our text.

## AES - Advanced Encryption Standard

So AES, or the Advanced Encryption Standard, is a symmetric key encryption
algorithm that was originally developed by two Belgian cryptographers - Joan
Daemen, and Vincent Rijmen.

If you are wanting to use encryption within any of your programs and aren't
quite sure about how they all differ, then AES is definitely the safest option
to choose from due to both it's efficiency and ease of use.

### Symmetric Key Encryption

If you haven't come across the term symmetric key encryption, then fear not,
it's a relatively simple concept that essentially allows two parties to encrypt
and decrypt information using a shared secret.

## Our Encryption Client

Ok, let's jump into our code editor of choice and start writing some code!

We'll start by creating a new file called `encrypt.go` which will contain take
in a passphrase from the command line and subsequently use this to encrypt some
text before writing this to a file.

Let's start by simply encrypting a piece of text with a pre-set key and printing
out the results. Once we have this mastered, we can introduce more complexity:

```go
package main

import (
    "crypto/aes"
    "crypto/cipher"
    "crypto/rand"
    "fmt"
    "io"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Encryption Program v0.01")

    text := []byte("My Super Secret Code Stuff")
    key := []byte("passphrasewhichneedstobe32bytes!")

    // generate a new aes cipher using our 32 byte long key
    c, err := aes.NewCipher(key)
    // if there are any errors, handle them
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }

    // gcm or Galois/Counter Mode, is a mode of operation
    // for symmetric key cryptographic block ciphers
    // - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode
    gcm, err := cipher.NewGCM(c)
    // if any error generating new GCM
    // handle them
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }

    // creates a new byte array the size of the nonce
    // which must be passed to Seal
    nonce := make([]byte, gcm.NonceSize())
    // populates our nonce with a cryptographically secure
    // random sequence
    if _, err = io.ReadFull(rand.Reader, nonce); err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }

    // here we encrypt our text using the Seal function
    // Seal encrypts and authenticates plaintext, authenticates the
    // additional data and appends the result to dst, returning the updated
    // slice. The nonce must be NonceSize() bytes long and unique for all
    // time, for a given key.
    fmt.Println(gcm.Seal(nonce, nonce, text, nil))
}
```

So, if we try and run this with `go run encrypt.go` you should see that it
prints out both `Hello World` and an array of bytes which represent our
encrypted `text`.

Let's try and write this to a file now by adding a call to `ioutile.WriteFile`,
in place of our final `fmt.Println` statement:

```go
// the WriteFile method returns an error if unsuccessful
err = ioutil.WriteFile("myfile.data", gcm.Seal(nonce, nonce, text, nil), 0777)
// handle this error
if err != nil {
  // print it out
  fmt.Println(err)
}
```

### Testing it Out

Once we have finished making these changes to our `encrypt.go` file, we can try
testing it out:

```s
$ go run encrypt.go
```

If this runs successfully, you should see a new file created within your
project's directory called `myfile.data`. If you open this up, you should see
the results of your encryption!

## Our Decryption Client

Now that we've covered encryption and writing our encrypted message to a file,
let's now have a look at reading from that file and trying to decrypt that using
the same shared key.

We'll start by using `ioutil.ReadFile('myfile.data')` in order to read in the
encrypted text as a byte array. Once we have this byte array, we'll be able to
subsequently follow very similar steps as we did for the encryption side of
things.

1. First we need to create a new Cipher using the `aes.NewCipher` function,
   passing in our shared key as it's primary parameter.
1. Next, we need to generate our GCM
1. After that we need to get our Nonce size using `gcm.NonceSize()`
1. Finally we will decrypt our encrypted `ciphertext` using the `gcm.Open()`
   function which returns both our `plaintext` and/or an `error` if there is
   any.

```go
package main

import (
    "crypto/aes"
    "crypto/cipher"
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Decryption Program v0.01")

    key := []byte("passphrasewhichneedstobe32bytes!")
    ciphertext, err := ioutil.ReadFile("myfile.data")
    // if our program was unable to read the file
    // print out the reason why it can't
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }

    c, err := aes.NewCipher(key)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }

    gcm, err := cipher.NewGCM(c)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }

    nonceSize := gcm.NonceSize()
    if len(ciphertext) < nonceSize {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }

    nonce, ciphertext := ciphertext[:nonceSize], ciphertext[nonceSize:]
    plaintext, err := gcm.Open(nil, nonce, ciphertext, nil)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(string(plaintext))
}
```

### Testing it Out

Awesome, so now that we have finished writing our `decrypt.go` program, we can
try it out.

```s
$ go run decrypt.go
Decryption Program v0.01
My Super Secret Code Stuff
```

As you can see from the output, we have been able to successfully read the
encrypted contents of our `myfile.data` file and subsequently decrypt it using
our shared secret key.

## Challenge - Encrypted FileSystem

If you are interested in a challenge, a cool way to test what you have learned
in this tutorial would be to try and extend the existing program that we've
created above to encrypt and decrypt any files given to it using a passphrase.

You could potentially turn this into a CLI that accepts flags and filepaths as
input and outputs them in encrypted form to your current location.

## Conclusion

So, in this tutorial we have successfully covered a number of cool concepts such
as symmetric encryption algorithms, and how to encrypt and decrypt information
using the Advanced Encryption Standard and a secret key.

I had a lot of fun writing this and hopefully you enjoyed it! If you did, or if
you have any feedback, then I would love to hear it in the comments section
below!
