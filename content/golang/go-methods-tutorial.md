In this tutorial, we are going to first of all look at what methods are and how
they work within the confines of the Go programming language. We'll then take a
look at demystifying the differences between both methods and functions and when
you should ideally use them within your Go programs.

## A Simple Example

Let's start off by covering what methods and how we can implement our own in our
Go systems. We'll be creating an incredibly simple employee management system
that allows you to Update an employees name and print that name out. Not the
most exciting of example projects, but it'll serve it's purpose as a means of
demonstration.

We'll first of all create a `struct` of type `Employee` which features one string
field, `Name`.

Next we'll declare an `UpdateName()` and a `PrintName()` method which will allow
us to update and print the names of any employees we create.

<div class="filename">main.go</div>

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

type Employee struct {
    Name string
}

func (e *Employee) UpdateName(newName string) {
    e.Name = newName
}

func (e *Employee) PrintName() {
    fmt.Println(e.Name)
}

func main() {
    var employee Employee
    employee.Name = "Elliot"
    employee.UpdateName("Forbsey")
    employee.PrintName()
}

```

> **Note -** One thing you should note when working with methods is that, like
> functions, they create copies of the arguments passed into it. To avoid this,
> we can use pointer receivers when defining our methods.

> `func (pointer *Pointer) myMethod()`

So why do we use methods at all within our Go programs?

## Functions Vs Methods

Well, there is a subtle distinction between your traditional functions in Go and
your Methods. Methods typically act upon a given object, i.e.
`guitarist.Update(params)` and using it in this fashion is typically far
preferential than doing `UpdateGuitarist(guitarist, params)` when it comes to
writing your code.

```go
func UpdateGuitarist(guitarist *Guitarist, params ParamsStruct) {
  fmt.Println("This is a simple function")
}

// Calling this function
UpdateGuitarist(guitarist, params)
```

In the above example, you'll notice that we have to pass in both the guitarist
and the parameters we wish to update the guitarist with. However, if we were to
implement this same function as a method, it would tend to look cleaner when
calling it:

```go
func (g *Guitarist) Update(params ParamsStruct) {
  fmt.Println("This is a simple method")
}

// this is far nicer in my opinion
myGuitarist.Update(params)
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned what methods are and how they differ from functions
in go.
