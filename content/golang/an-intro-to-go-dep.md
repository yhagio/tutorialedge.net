In this tutorial, we are going to look at how you can use the `Dep` tool in go
to manage your Go's project dependencies.

## Why dep?

The `dep` tool is the "official experiment" dependency management tool for the
go programming language. It helps you to manage the ever-growing list of
dependencies your project needs to maintain without a lot of overhead and it can
pin you to specific versions of dependencies to ensure stability in your
systems.

Without a dependency management tool, you may find yourself in a lot of pain
when it comes to developing multiple different Go programs on the same machine.
You may find that updating a particular dependency that is used by 6 projects on
your machine ends up breaking 3 of said projects due to a small API change.

## Installation

Installation of the `dep` tool can be done using homebrew, like so:

```bash
$ brew install dep
$ brew upgrade dep
```

Once these 2 commands have been run, you should have the `dep` CLI available to
you within your terminal.

### dep init

When getting started with the `dep` tool, the first thing you will typically
have to run is the `dep init` command. This command does a lot of things and can
be run on existing Go projects as well as newer ones.

When you call `dep init`, the tool does a few things:

1. It identifies the dependencies of your current project
2. It validates whether or not these dependencies use the `dep` tool
3. It picks the highest compatible version for each of these dependencies

## Creating a New Project

When it comes to creating a new project that relies upon `dep` you have a few
options. The first and possibly best option is to create your project within
your `$GOPATH`, much like you normally would, `cd` into that directory and then
call `dep init`:

```c
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/my/project
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/my/project
$ dep init
$ ls
Gopkg.toml Gopkg.lock vendor/
```

### Gopkg.toml

The `Gopkg.toml` file is where you specify your dependencies and the particular
versions of these dependencies that you wish your project to use. Think of this
as your `package.json` if you are coming from a `NodeJS` background, or your
`pom.xml` if you are coming from a `Java` background.

### Gopkg.lock

The `Gopkg.lock` file is a transitively complete snapshot of your project's
dependency graph that is expressed as a series of `[[project]]` stanzas.

In layman's terms this is a list of every dependency and the particular revision
of that dependency.

### The vendor/ Directory

The `vendor/` directory is where your dependencies are stored. It's the
equivalent to the `node_modules/` directory in your `NodeJS` projects.

## Helpful Commands

The `dep` command features 5 commands in total:

- `init` - Sets up a new Go project
- `status` - Reports the status of a project's dependencies
- `ensure` - Ensures a dependency is safely vendored in the project
- `prune` - Prunes your dependencies, this is also done automatically by
  `ensure`
- `version` - Shows the dep version information

You'll typically only work with the first 3 commands so I'll just be covering
these in more detail.

### dep ensure

The `dep ensure` command is quite possibly the most important command you will
need to come to grips with when it comes to working with the `dep` dependency
management tool.

### Adding Dependencies

If you want to add new dependencies to your project you can do so by calling the
`dep ensure -add` command and specifying the source for the project.

```go
$ dep ensure -add github.com/foo/bar github.com/another/project ...
```

### Updating Dependencies

Should you wish to update some of the dependencies within your project you can
do that using the `-update` flag when calling `dep ensure`:

```go
// dry run testing an update
$ dep ensure -update -n
// non-dry run
$ dep ensure -update
// updates a specific package
$ dep ensure -update github.com/gorilla/mux
// updates to a specific version
$ dep ensure -update github.com/gorilla/mux@1.0.0
```

### dep status

The `dep status` command reports the status of a project's dependencies:

```go
$ dep status
// output
...
```

the `dep` tool. If you require any further assistance then please do not
