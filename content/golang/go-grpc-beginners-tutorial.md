**Welcome fellow Gophers!** A lot of you have requested that I write a tutorial on the topic of gRPC and how you can write your own gRPC-based systems in Go. So, in this tutorial we'll be diving into the wonderful and exciting world of gRPC and exploring how we can leverage it for fame and fortune!

We'll be diving in to the theory behind gRPC and why is can be better in some situations when compared to more traditional setups like `HTTP REST` APIs. 

Once we have a firm handle as to how gRPC can benefit our systems, we'll then be taking a look at how we can build simple gRPC clients and servers that are written in Go! 

> **Note** - If you haven't already, I would check out the other tutorial on this site covering [Protocol Buffers in Go](/golang/go-protocol-buffer-tutorial/)

## Prerequisites

**Before you can complete this tutorial**, you will have to have the following installed on your machine:

* Protocol Buffers v3 installed - this can be done by running `go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go`

You will have to ensure that `$GOPATH/bin` is on your environment path so that you can use the `protoc` tool later on in this tutorial.

## gRPC Introduction

So, before we dive in, we first need to understand what gRPC is, how it works and so on. 

> **Definition -** _gRPC is a modern, open source remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can run anywhere_

Remote Procedure Calls are something that we use within distributed systems that allow us to communicate between applications. More specifically, it allows us to expose methods within our application that we want other applications to be able to invoke. 

It's similar to REST API communication in the sense that with it, you are effectively exposing functionality within your app to other apps using a HTTP connection as the communication medium.

## Differences between gRPC and REST

Whilst REST and gRPC are somewhat similar, there are some fundamental differences in how they work that you should be aware of.

1. gRPC utilizes `HTTP/2` whereas REST utilizes `HTTP 1.1`
1. gRPC utilizes the protocol buffer data format as opposed to the standard JSON data format
that is typically used within REST APIs
1. With gRPC you can utilize `HTTP/2` capabilities such as server-side streaming, client-side streaming
or even bidirectional-streaming should you wish.

## Challenges with gRPC

You should bear in mind that whilst gRPC does allow you to utilize these newer bits of technology, it is more challenging prototyping a gRPC service due to the fact that tools like the Postman HTTP client cannot be used in order to easily interact with your exposed gRPC service. 

You do have options that make this possible, but it's not something that's readily available natively. There are options to use tools such as envoy to reverse proxy standard JSON requests and transcode them into the right data format but this is an additional dependency that can be tricky to set up for simple projects.

## Building a gRPC Server in Go

Let's start off by defining a really simple gRPC server in Go. Once we have a simple server up and running we can set about creating a gRPC client that will be able to interact with it.

We will start off by writing the logic within our `main` function to listen on a port for incoming TCP connections:

<div class="filename"> main.go </div>

```go
package main

import ( 
  "log"
  "net"
)

func main() {
  lis, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":9000")
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("failed to listen: %v", err)
  }
}
```

Next, we'll want to import the official `gRPC` package from `golang.org` so that we can create a new gRPC server, then register the endpoints we want to expose before serving this over our existing `TCP` connection that we have defined above:

<div class="filename"> main.go </div> 

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net"

	"google.golang.org/grpc"
)

func main() {

	lis, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":9000")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to listen: %v", err)
	}

	grpcServer := grpc.NewServer()

	if err := grpcServer.Serve(lis); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to serve: %s", err)
	}
}
```

This right here is the absolute minimum for a gRPC server written in go. However, right now it doesn't exactly do much. 

### Adding Some Functionality

Let's see how we can start exposing some functionality via our gRPC server so that gRCP clients can interact with our server in a meaningful way. 

Let's start by defining the `chat.proto` file which will act as our contract:

<div class="filename"> chat.proto </div>

```go
syntax = "proto3";
package chat;

message Message {
  string body = 1;
}

service ChatService {
  rpc SayHello(Message) returns (Message) {}
}
```

This `.proto` file exposes our `ChatService` which features a solitary `SayHello` function which can be called by any gRPC client written in any language.

These `.proto` definitions are typically shared across clients of all shapes and sizes so that they can generate their own code to talk to our gRPC server.

Let's generate the Go specific gRPC code using the `protoc` tool:

```output
$ protoc --go_out=plugins=grpc:chat chat.proto
```

You'll see this will have generated a `chat/chat.pb.go` file which will contain generated code for us to easily call within our code. Let's update our `server.go` to register our ChatService like so:

<div class="filename"> server.go </div>

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net"

	"github.com/tutorialedge/go-grpc-beginners-tutorial/chat"
	"google.golang.org/grpc"
)

func main() {

	fmt.Println("Go gRPC Beginners Tutorial!")

	lis, err := net.Listen("tcp", fmt.Sprintf(":%d", 9000))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to listen: %v", err)
	}

	s := chat.Server{}

	grpcServer := grpc.NewServer()

	chat.RegisterChatServiceServer(grpcServer, &s)

	if err := grpcServer.Serve(lis); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to serve: %s", err)
	}
}

```

We are then going to have to define the `SayHello` method which will take in a `Message`, read the Body of the message and then return a `Message` of it's own:

<div class="filename"> chat/chat.go </div>

```go
package chat

import (
	"log"

	"golang.org/x/net/context"
)

type Server struct {
}

func (s *Server) SayHello(ctx context.Context, in *Message) (*Message, error) {
	log.Printf("Receive message body from client: %s", in.Body)
	return &Message{Body: "Hello From the Server!"}, nil
}

```

If we wanted to define more advanced functionality for our gRPC server then we could do so by defining a new method built off our Server `struct` and then add the name of that function to our `chat.proto` file so that our application can expose this as something that other gRPC clients can hit.

With these final changes in place, let's try running our server:

```output
$ go run server.go
Go gRPC Beginners Tutorial!
```

Awesome! We now have a brand spanking, shiny new gRPC server up and running on `localhost:9000` on our machine! 

## Building a gRPC Client in Go

Now that we have our server up and running, let's take a look at how we can build up a simple client
that will be able to interact with it.

<div class="filename"> client.go </div>

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"golang.org/x/net/context"
	"google.golang.org/grpc"

	"github.com/tutorialedge/go-grpc-beginners-tutorial/chat"
)

func main() {

	var conn *grpc.ClientConn
	conn, err := grpc.Dial(":9000", grpc.WithInsecure())
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("did not connect: %s", err)
	}
	defer conn.Close()

	c := chat.NewChatServiceClient(conn)

	response, err := c.SayHello(context.Background(), &chat.Message{Body: "Hello From Client!"})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Error when calling SayHello: %s", err)
	}
	log.Printf("Response from server: %s", response.Body)

}

```

When we go to run this, we should see that our client gets a very nice `Hello` message back from the server like so:

```output
$ go run client.go
2020/04/30 20:10:09 Response from server: Hello From the Server!
```

Awesome, we have successfully created a very simple gRPC client that now talks to our new gRPC server!

## Challenge

> **Challenge** - Add a new method called `BroadcastMessage` to our gRPC server. 

<details>
  <summary>Challenge Spoiler</summary>
  
  You start off by modifying the `chat.proto` file which contains your gRPC contract. You add a new `rpc` definition to your `ChatService` which has the name `BroadcastMessage`:
  
  ```go
  syntax = "proto3";
  package chat;

  message Message {
    string body = 1;
  }

  service ChatService {
    rpc SayHello(Message) returns (Message) {}
    rpc BroadcastMessage(Message) returns (Message) {}
  }
  ```
  
  With this in place, you then want to regenerate your `chat.pb.go` file from this updated contract: 

  ```output
  $ protoc --go_out=plugins=grpc:chat chat.proto
  ```

  And then you will have to add this method definition to your `chat/chat.go` file:

  ```go
  package chat

  import (
    "log"

    "golang.org/x/net/context"
  )

  type Server struct {
  }

  func (s *Server) SayHello(ctx context.Context, in *Message) (*Message, error) {
    log.Printf("Receive message body from client: %s", in.Body)
    return &Message{Body: "Hello From the Server!"}, nil
  }

  func (s *Server) BroadcastMessage(ctx context.Context, in *Message) (*Message, error) {
    log.Printf("Broadcasting new message from a client: %s", in.Body)
    return &Message{Body: "Broadcasted message!"}, nil
  }
  ```

  Finally, you can update your `client.go` code to call this new gRPC endpoint:

  ```go
  package main

  import (
    "log"

    "golang.org/x/net/context"
    "google.golang.org/grpc"

    "github.com/tutorialedge/go-grpc-beginners-tutorial/chat"
  )

  func main() {

    var conn *grpc.ClientConn
    conn, err := grpc.Dial(":9000", grpc.WithInsecure())
    if err != nil {
      log.Fatalf("did not connect: %s", err)
    }
    defer conn.Close()

    c := chat.NewChatServiceClient(conn)

    response, err := c.SayHello(context.Background(), &chat.Message{Body: "Hello From Client!"})
    if err != nil {
      log.Fatalf("Error when calling SayHello: %s", err)
    }
    log.Printf("Response from server: %s", response.Body)

    response, err = c.BroadcastMessage(context.Background(), &chat.Message{Body: "Message to Broadcast!"})
    if err != nil {
      log.Fatalf("Error when calling Broadcast Message: %s", err)
    }
    log.Printf("Response from server: %s", response.Body)

  }
  ```

  Awesome! You have successfully added a new gRPC endpoint!

</details>

## Conclusion

So, in this tutorial, we've looked at how you can build out a simple gRPC client and server in Go. We built up a basic server that accepts incoming messages from a client and then returns a response to those clients.  

Now, this is just the start of my dive into gRPC and over the coming weeks we'll be expanding on the foundations laid out in this article and we'll be taking a look at more complex topics such as authentication and authorization as well as 2-way streaming!
