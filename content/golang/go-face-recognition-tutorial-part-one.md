The whole area of Face Recognition is something I love reading about.
Implementing a facial recognition system yourself makes you sound like you are
Tony Stark and you can use them for a variety of different projects such as an
automatic lock on your door, or building a surveillance system for your office
to name but a few.

In this tutorial, we are going to be building our own, really simple face
recognition based system in Go using a few existing libraries. We'll start by
doing simple face recognition on still images and seeing how that works and
we'll then be expanding upon this to look into real-time face recognition on
video feeds in part 2 of this mini-series.

## The Kagami/go-face package

For the basis of this tutorial, we'll be using the
[kagami/go-face](https://github.com/Kagami/go-face) package which wraps around
the dlib machine learning toolkit!

> **Note -** Kagami actually wrote about how he went about writing this package.

### The dlib toolkit

The Dlib toolkit is built in C++ and is incredible at both face and object
recognition/detection. According to its documentation, it scores around 99.4%
accuracy on detecting labeled faces in the Wild benchmark which is incredible
and it's the reason why so many other third-party libraries utilize it as their
base.

> **Note -** I've covered the Dlib toolkit's Python library - face_recognition
> in a previous tutorial. If you want to check out the python equivalent of this

## Setup

I'm not going to lie, getting this up and running is slightly more painful than
your standard Go package. You'll need to install both `pkg-config` and `dlib` on
your machine. If you are running on MacOS then this is the command:

```s
$ brew install pkg-config dlib
$ sed -i '' 's/^Libs: .*/& -lblas -llapack/' /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/dlib-1.pc
```

## Getting Started

We'll first of all need to download the `kagami/go-face` package which can be
done with the following `go get` command:

```s
$ go get -u github.com/Kagami/go-face
```

Create a new directory called `go-face-recognition` in your GOPATH directory.
Within this directory create a new file called `main.go`, this is where all of
our source code is going to reside.

Once you've done this, you will need to grab the files from the `image/`
directory in the
[TutorialEdge/go-face-recognition-tutorial](https://github.com/TutorialEdge/go-face-recognition-tutorial)
repo. The easiest way to do this is to clone the repo into another directory and
just copy the image directory into your current working directory:

```s
$ git clone https://github.com/TutorialEdge/go-face-recognition-tutorial.git
```

Once that has been successfully cloned, we have both the `.dat` files that we
need in order to kick off our face recognition program. You should also see a
list of other `.jpg` files which contain the faces of some of the Marvel
Avengers.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/Kagami/go-face"
)

const dataDir = "testdata"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Facial Recognition System v0.01")

    rec, err := face.NewRecognizer(dataDir)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Cannot initialize recognizer")
    }
    defer rec.Close()

    fmt.Println("Recognizer Initialized")
}
```

Ok, so if we try and run our program at this point, we should see both
`Facial Recognition System v0.01` and `Recognizer Initialized` in our program's
output. We've successfully set everything we need up in order to do some cool
advanced facial recognition!

## Counting Faces in a Picture

Our first real test of this package will be to test to see whether we can
accurately count the number of faces in a photograph. For the purpose of this
tutorial, I will be using this photo:

<img src="https://images.tutorialedge.net/images/tony-stark.jpg" style="width:25%; height: auto; margin: auto; display: block;"/>

As you can see, nothing fancy, just the solitary face of Tony Stark.

So, we now need to extend our existing program to be able to analyze this image
and then count the number of faces within said image:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "path/filepath"

    "github.com/Kagami/go-face"
)

const dataDir = "testdata"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Facial Recognition System v0.01")

    rec, err := face.NewRecognizer(dataDir)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Cannot initialize recognizer")
    }
    defer rec.Close()

    fmt.Println("Recognizer Initialized")

    // we create the path to our image with filepath.Join
    avengersImage := filepath.Join(dataDir, "tony-stark.jpg")

    // we then call RecognizeFile passing in the path
    // to our file to retrieve the number of faces and any
    // potential errors
    faces, err := rec.RecognizeFile(avengersImage)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Can't recognize: %v", err)
    }
    // we print out the number of faces in our image
    fmt.Println("Number of Faces in Image: ", len(faces))

}
```

When we run this, we should see the following output:

```s
$ go run main.go
Facial Recognition System v0.01
Recognizer Initialized
Number of Faces in Image:  1
```

Awesome, we've been able to analyze an image and determine that the image
contains the face of one person. Let's try a more complex image with more of the
Avengers in it:

![](https://images.tutorialedge.net/images/avengers-01.jpg)

When we update line 24:

```go
avengersImage := filepath.Join(dataDir, "avengers-01.jpg")
```

And re-run our program, you should see that our program is able to determine
that 2 people are in this new image.

## Recognizing Faces:

Sweet, so we're able to calculate the number of faces in an image, now what
about actually determining who those people are?

To do this, we'll need a number of reference photos. For example, if we wanted
to be able to recognize Tony Stark out of a photo, we would need example photos
tagged with his name. The recognition software would then be able to analyze
photos for faces with his likeness and match them together.

So, let's take our `avengers-02.jpg` as our reference image for Tony Stark and
then see if we can identify if this image contains his face:

<img src="https://images.tutorialedge.net/images/tony-stark.jpg" style="width:25%; height: auto; margin: auto; display: block;"/>

```go
avengersImage := filepath.Join(dataDir, "avengers-02.jpeg")

faces, err := rec.RecognizeFile(avengersImage)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Can't recognize: %v", err)
}
fmt.Println("Number of Faces in Image: ", len(faces))

var samples []face.Descriptor
var avengers []int32
for i, f := range faces {
    samples = append(samples, f.Descriptor)
    // Each face is unique on that image so goes to its own category.
    avengers = append(avengers, int32(i))
}
// Name the categories, i.e. people on the image.
labels := []string{
    "Dr Strange",
    "Tony Stark",
    "Bruce Banner",
    "Wong",
}
// Pass samples to the recognizer.
rec.SetSamples(samples, avengers)
```

So, in the above code, we've gone through all of the faces in order from left to
right and labeled them with their appropriate names. Our recognition system can
then use these reference samples to try and perform it's own facial recognition
on subsequent files.

Let's try testing out our recognition system with our existing image of Tony
Stark and seeing if it's able to recognize this based of the face descriptor it
generated from the `avengers-02.jpeg` file:

```go
// Now let's try to classify some not yet known image.
testTonyStark := filepath.Join(dataDir, "tony-stark.jpg")
tonyStark, err := rec.RecognizeSingleFile(testTonyStark)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Can't recognize: %v", err)
}
if tonyStark == nil {
    log.Fatalf("Not a single face on the image")
}
avengerID := rec.Classify(tonyStark.Descriptor)
if avengerID < 0 {
    log.Fatalf("Can't classify")
}

fmt.Println(avengerID)
fmt.Println(labels[avengerID])
```

Let's now try to validate that this wasn't a fluke and try to see if our image
recognition system works with an image of Dr Strange.

<img src="https://images.tutorialedge.net/images/dr-strange.jpg" style="width:25%; height: auto; margin: auto; display: block;"/>

```go
testDrStrange := filepath.Join(dataDir, "dr-strange.jpg")
drStrange, err := rec.RecognizeSingleFile(testDrStrange)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Can't recognize: %v", err)
}
if drStrange == nil {
    log.Fatalf("Not a single face on the image")
}
avengerID = rec.Classify(drStrange.Descriptor)
if avengerID < 0 {
    log.Fatalf("Can't classify")
}
```

And finally, let's try this out using Wong's image:

<img src="https://images.tutorialedge.net/images/wong.jpg" style="width:25%; height: auto; margin: auto; display: block;"/>

```go
testWong := filepath.Join(dataDir, "wong.jpg")
wong, err := rec.RecognizeSingleFile(testWong)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Can't recognize: %v", err)
}
if wong == nil {
    log.Fatalf("Not a single face on the image")
}
avengerID = rec.Classify(wong.Descriptor)
if avengerID < 0 {
    log.Fatalf("Can't classify")
}
fmt.Println(avengerID)
fmt.Println(labels[avengerID])
```

When you run this all together, you should see the following output:

```s
$ go run main.go
Facial Recognition System v0.01
Recognizer Initialized
Number of Faces in Image:  4
1
Tony Stark
0
Dr Strange
3
Wong
```

Awesome, we've managed to build up a really simple face recognition system that
allows us to identify the various different Avengers.

> Challenge: Build up a number of reference files on all of the Avengers and try
> to extract out the face recognition code snippets into a reusable function
