  package main

  import (

    "strings"
  )

  func main() {
    originalString := "This is our original string"

    doesContain := strings.Contains(originalString, "our")
    fmt.Println(doesContain)

    doesNotContain := strings.Contains(originalString, "meh")
    fmt.Println(doesNotContain)
  }

In this snippet, we are going to see how we can test if a string contains another string in Go.

To do this we'll be using the standard library `strings` package as it contains an incredibly handy function `Contains` which we can pass 2 arguments into. The first argument is our full string, the second is the string we want to check for.

In this example, we have our `originalString` which we test to see if it contains the string `our`. 

We then use the same function to check a negative case and see if `meh` exists in the second string.
