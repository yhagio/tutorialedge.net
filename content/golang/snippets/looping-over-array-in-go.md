In this code snippet, we are going to take a look at how you can quickly iterate over an array of type strings in Go.

We'll use the `range` keyword to allow us to iterate over the `scientists` array that we have created. This will return 2 values, the first will be the `index`, the second is the value. 

In this instance we ignore the `index` returned by utilizing an `_` in its place. We then print out the value within the body of our `for` loop.
