  package main

  import "fmt"

  func main() {

      mymap := make(map[string]int)

      mymap["elliot"] = 25

      // we can use this if statement to check to see if 
      // a given key "elliot" exists within a map in Go
      if _, ok := mymap["elliot"]; ok {
          // the key 'elliot' exists within the map
          fmt.Println(mymap["elliot"])
      }
  }

When we execute this, we will see the following output:

<div class="filename"> $ go run main.go </div>

```output
25
```

When we execute the call to `mymap['key']` we get back two distinct values, the first of which is the value of the key and the second is a `bool` value which represents whether or not the given key exists within the map. 

This second value is what we use to check if a given key exists in the `if` statement on line 13. We first do an assignment using `_, ok := mymap["elliot"];` before then using the `ok` value as a conditional for our `if` statement. 

Only if the value exists in the map does the body of the `if` statement execute.
