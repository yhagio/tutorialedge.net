    func main() {
        scientists := []string{
            "Einstein",
            "Turing",
            "Lovelace",
            "Curie",
            "Franklin",
            "Hodgkin",
        }

        scientists = append(scientists, "Hawkins")

        fmt.Println(scientists)

In this quick snippet, we are going to look at how you can add values to an array in Go using the `append` function.

In this example, we define an array of type `string` which contains a list of scientists. Below where we create this array we use the `append` function to then add `Hawkins` to the list of scientists.

## The append Function

The `append` function is a built-in function which appends elements to the end of a slice. It takes care of allocating the underlying arrays should they need to be resized to accommodate any new elements and then returns the new slice.
