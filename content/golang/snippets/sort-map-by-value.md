      keys = append(keys, key)
    }

    // use the sort method to sort our keys array
    sort.Strings(keys)

> In this code snippet, we are going to look at how you can quickly and easily sort maps in Go using the `sort` package.


When we run this, we should see that we are able to retrieve the values from our map in
order of the length of the string key.

<div class="filename"> $ go run main.go </div>

```output
Elliot 25
Fraser 20
Sophie 24
```

<!-- ## Sort Map by Integer Value

```go
mymap := map[string]int{"Elliot": 25, "Sophie": 24, "Fraser": 20}

```

<div class="filename"> $ output </div>

```output 

``` -->
