    t, err := time.Parse(layout, str)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
     
    fmt.Println(t.Weekday()) // Tuesday
    fmt.Println(t.Day()) // 05
    fmt.Println(t.Month()) // May
  }

In this code snippet, we are going to look at how you can parse date & time strings in Go using the `time` package.

In this example, we use the `time.Parse` function which takes in the date layout as well as the date string we wish to parse.

## List of Popular Layouts

Here you'll find a list of the most popular date format layouts that you can use to parse your date strings:

```go
const (
    ANSIC       = "Mon Jan _2 15:04:05 2006"
    UnixDate    = "Mon Jan _2 15:04:05 MST 2006"
    RubyDate    = "Mon Jan 02 15:04:05 -0700 2006"
    RFC822      = "02 Jan 06 15:04 MST"
    RFC822Z     = "02 Jan 06 15:04 -0700" // RFC822 with numeric zone
    RFC850      = "Monday, 02-Jan-06 15:04:05 MST"
    RFC1123     = "Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 MST"
    RFC1123Z    = "Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 -0700" // RFC1123 with numeric zone
    RFC3339     = "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"
    RFC3339Nano = "2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00"
    Kitchen     = "3:04PM"
    // Handy time stamps.
    Stamp      = "Jan _2 15:04:05"
    StampMilli = "Jan _2 15:04:05.000"
    StampMicro = "Jan _2 15:04:05.000000"
    StampNano  = "Jan _2 15:04:05.000000000"
)
```
