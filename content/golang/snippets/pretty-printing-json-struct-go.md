ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this snippet, we are going to look at how you can pretty-print JSON in Go using the `json` package!

In this example we have a simple interface called `Flight` which we want to pretty print the values for.

We can use the `json.MarshalIndent` function which takes in the `interface` we want to marshal as well as the `prefix` string and the `indent` string. In this example we don't use a prefix, but we do set the indent to 2 empty spaces.
