In this code snippet, we are going to look at how you can compare two `structs` in Go to see if they are equal. 

We'll be creating a simple `Developer` struct which will feature a `Name` and `Age` field. 

In the body of our `main` function, we'll define two instances of this `struct` called `elliot` and `elliot2` - not the most imaginative I know...

Below this, we'll then use the `reflect` package from the Go standard library in order to perform a `DeepEqual` comparison.

<Quiz question="What happens if we try and compare 2 different struct types with the same fields and values using the DeepEqual function?" answer="DeepEqual does a test to see whether or not the two instances are they same type" correct="B" A="It returns true" B="It returns false" />
