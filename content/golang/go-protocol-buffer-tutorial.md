Welcome fellow coders! In this tutorial, we are going to be looking at how you
can utilize the Protocol Buffers data format within your Go-based applications.
We'll be covering what the data format is, and why it is an improvement over
more traditional data formats such as XML or even JSON. And we'll dive into a
simple example to get us up and running before trying our hands at a more
complex example.

By the end of this tutorial, you should be fairly comfortable with the basics
and you'll subsequently be able to go out and build your own more advanced
systems.

## The Protocol Buffer Data Format

Protocol buffers, are essentially a data format, much like JSON or XML in the
sense that they store structured data which can be serialized or de-serialized
by a wide number of different languages.

The main advantage of this format is that it's a hell of a lot smaller when
compared to the likes of XML or even JSON. It was a format that was originally
developed by Google, who are fairly well known company that are at such a size,
that every byte they can save makes a difference.

Imagine we had a person, who's data we wanted to represent in the 3 separate
data formats:

```xml
<person>
  <name>Elliot</name>
  <age>24</age>
</person>
```

We could represent this data in a far smaller size footprint in JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "Elliot",
  "age": 24
}
```

And if we were to represent this same data using the protocol buffer data
format:

```c
[10 6 69 108 108 105 111 116 16 24]
```

If you look closely at the above wire encoded output, you may see that, starting
from position 2 in the array, the name `elliot` is spelled out, `e` = 69, `l` =
108 and so on. This is followed by the byte representation of my current
age, 24.

There's a bit more to the encoding format than meets the eye though and it's
something I'm still attempting to learn about in more detail, should you wish,
I'd recommend checking out Google's own documentation here:
[Protocol Buffer Encoding](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding).

Now, whilst the respective size of both the JSON and the Protocol Buffer
representation may be similar at this scale, but when we start to consider
scenarios where our data is larger than your standard "getting started" example,
the savings start to ramp up.

## A Simple Example

```s
& go get github.com/golang/protobuf
$ go get github.com/golang/protobuf/proto
```

This will download the necessary packages we'll need to get our really simple
example up and running.

```s
$ export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

With this set, you should have the necessary `protoc` binary available in your
terminal. We can then go about defining our `protobuf` schema, in this example,
we'll be trying to represent the same `person` object we used to highlight the
differences between the various data formats above.

We'll start off by specifying the syntax we want to use, in this example
`proto3` suits our needs. We'll then specify that we want this to be part of the
`main` package.

Finally we define how we want our object to look. This consists of our message
format of type `Person` which features two fields, `name` and `age`.

<div class="filename">person.proto</div>

```proto
syntax="proto3";

package main;

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

And we can then compile this using the `protoc` binary:

```s
$ protoc --go_out=. *.proto
```

We've finally got everything in place to start writing our go code. Let's start
by defining a new `Person` and then we can marshal this object into a `protobuf`
object.

To get an understanding as to how this is stored, we call `fmt.Println(data)` to
print out the wire encoded format that stores our `protobuf` object.

<div class="filename">main.go</div>

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"

    "github.com/golang/protobuf/proto"
)

func main() {

    elliot := &Person{
        Name: "Elliot",
        Age:  24,
    }

    data, err := proto.Marshal(elliot)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal("marshaling error: ", err)
    }

  // printing out our raw protobuf object
    fmt.Println(data)

  // let's go the other way and unmarshal
  // our byte array into an object we can modify
  // and use
    newElliot := &Person{}
    err = proto.Unmarshal(data, newElliot)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal("unmarshaling error: ", err)
  }

  // print out our `newElliot` object
  // for good measure
  fmt.Println(newElliot.GetAge())
    fmt.Println(newElliot.GetName())

}
```

When we run this, we need to ensure that we pass in our `test.pb.go` file as
well in order for this to work:

<div class="filename"> $ go run main.go test.pb.go</div>

```s
[10 6 69 108 108 105 111 116 16 24]
name:"Elliot" age:24
```

## Nested Fields

Ok, so we've managed to get a fairly simple example up and running, but in the
real-world, we will most likely have multiple nested fields within our message
format and we'll be modifying some of the values etc.

Let's take a look at how we can start working with nested fields. We'll continue
using our `Person` message type and we'll add a nested field which will contain
social media followers.

We can compose our Person of standard field types and a custom `SocialFollowers`
message type like so:

<div class="filename">main.go</div>

```c
syntax="proto3";

package main;

message SocialFollowers {
  int32 youtube = 1;
  int32 twitter = 2;
}

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
    SocialFollowers socialFollowers = 3;
}
```

Once, we've made these changes we'll then have to rerun the `protoc` command:

```s
$ protoc --go_out=. *.proto
```

And then when we come back into our Go program, we can populate our `elliot`
object with `SocialFollowers`:

<div class="filename">main.go</div>

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"

    "github.com/golang/protobuf/proto"
)

func main() {

    elliot := Person{
        Name: "Elliot",
        Age:  24,
        SocialFollowers: &SocialFollowers{
            Youtube: 2500,
            Twitter: 1400,
        },
    }

    data, err := proto.Marshal(&elliot)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal("marshaling error: ", err)
    }

    // let's go the other way and unmarshal
    // our protocol buffer into an object we can modify
    // and use
    newElliot := &Person{}
    err = proto.Unmarshal(data, newElliot)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal("unmarshaling error: ", err)
    }

    // print out our `newElliot` object
    // for good measure
    fmt.Println(newElliot.GetName())
    fmt.Println(newElliot.GetAge())
    fmt.Println(newElliot.SocialFollowers.GetTwitter())
    fmt.Println(newElliot.SocialFollowers.GetYoutube())

}
```

When we run this for a final time, we see that everything is printed out as
expected:

<div class="filename"> $ go run main.go test.pb.go</div>

```s
Elliot
24
1400
2500
```

So, in this tutorial, we had a good look at how you can get up and running with
the protocol buffer data format within your own Go-based applications.
