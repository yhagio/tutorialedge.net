As you continue your Golang learning journey, it becomes almost inevitable that
you will have to interact with some form of database.

In this tutorial I’ll be demonstrating how you can connect to a MySQL database
and perform basic SQL statements using Go.

## Why MySQL?

MySQL is one of the most well-known and well-used database technologies
available to developers at the present point in time. It has an absolutely
massive community around it and it's quite possibly powering half the web as the
main database technology for Wordpress.

It's incredibly easy to spin up a MySQL instance locally and thus it's perfect
for building some decent applications on top of.

> **Note -** Technology choice shouldn't be based on popularity, there may be
> scenarios where you need to consider alternatives such as CockroachDB or NoSQL
> databases.

## Text Tutorial

In order to do this we’ll be using [https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql)
as our MySQL driver. `Go-SQL-Driver` is a lightweight and fast MySQL driver that
supports connections over `TCP/IPv4`, `TCP/IPv6`, `Unix domain sockets` or
custom protocols and features automatic handling of broken connections.

## Connection Pooling

If you are building high-performance database applications, connection-pooling
is an absolute **must**.

Thankfully, the opensource package that we'll be using for the basis of this
tutorial features automatic connection-pooling thanks to it's use of of the
`database/sql` standard package.

This essentially means that, every time you query your database, you are using a
connection from a pool of connections that have been set up on application
startup. These connections are reused, time and time again, and this
subsequently means you aren't creating and destroying a new connection every
time you perform a query.

## Implementation

We’ll begin by connecting to a database we’ve set up on our local machine and
then go on to perform some basic insert and select statements.

### Connecting to a MySQL database

Let's create a new `main.go` file. Within this, we'll import a few packages and
set up a simple connection to an already running local database. For the purpose
of this tutorial, I've started MySQL using phpmyadmin and I've created a
database called `test` to connect to and create tables within.

We'll use `sql.Open` to connect to our database and set up our automatic
connection pool, this will return either `db` or an `err` that we can handle.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "database/sql"
    _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Go MySQL Tutorial")

    // Open up our database connection.
    // I've set up a database on my local machine using phpmyadmin.
    // The database is called testDb
    db, err := sql.Open("mysql", "username:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/test")

    // if there is an error opening the connection, handle it
    if err != nil {
        panic(err.Error())
    }

    // defer the close till after the main function has finished
    // executing
    defer db.Close()

}
```

### Performing Basic SQL Commands

So, now that we've created a connection, we need to start submitting queries to
the database.

Thankfully, `db.Query(sql)` allows us to perform any SQL command we so desire.
We can simply construct the query string and pass it in as a parameter.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "database/sql"
    _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Go MySQL Tutorial")

    // Open up our database connection.
    // I've set up a database on my local machine using phpmyadmin.
    // The database is called testDb
    db, err := sql.Open("mysql", "root:password1@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/test")

    // if there is an error opening the connection, handle it
    if err != nil {
        panic(err.Error())
    }

    // defer the close till after the main function has finished
    // executing
    defer db.Close()

    // perform a db.Query insert
    insert, err := db.Query("INSERT INTO test VALUES ( 2, 'TEST' )")

    // if there is an error inserting, handle it
    if err != nil {
        panic(err.Error())
    }
    // be careful deferring Queries if you are using transactions
    defer insert.Close()


}
```

## Populating Structs from Results

Retrieving a set of results from the database is all well and good, but we need
to be able to read these results or populating existing `structs` so that we can
parse them and modify them easily. In order to parse a number of rows we can use
the `.Scan(args...)` method which takes in any number of arguments and allows us
to populate a composite object.

```go
/*
 * Tag... - a very simple struct
 */
type Tag struct {
    ID   int    `json:"id"`
    Name string `json:"name"`
}
```

```go
func main() {
    // Open up our database connection.
    db, err := sql.Open("mysql", "root:pass1@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/tuts")

    // if there is an error opening the connection, handle it
    if err != nil {
        log.Print(err.Error())
    }
    defer db.Close()

    // Execute the query
    results, err := db.Query("SELECT id, name FROM tags")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err.Error()) // proper error handling instead of panic in your app
    }

    for results.Next() {
        var tag Tag
        // for each row, scan the result into our tag composite object
        err = results.Scan(&tag.ID, &tag.Name)
        if err != nil {
            panic(err.Error()) // proper error handling instead of panic in your app
        }
                // and then print out the tag's Name attribute
        log.Printf(tag.Name)
    }

}
```

In this example we retrieved 2 columns from the tags database and then used
.Scan to populate our tag object.

> **Note -** If you retrieve 3 fields from the database and Scan only has 2
> parameters, it will fail. They need to match up exactly.

## Querying a Single Row

Say we wanted to query a single row this time and had an ID and again wanted to
populate our struct. We could do that like so:

```go
var tag Tag
// Execute the query
err = db.QueryRow("SELECT id, name FROM tags where id = ?", 2).Scan(&tag.ID, &tag.Name)
if err != nil {
    panic(err.Error()) // proper error handling instead of panic in your app
}

log.Println(tag.ID)
log.Println(tag.Name)
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we managed to set up a connection to a MySQL and then perform
some simple queries to that database and marshal the returned responses into a
`struct` or an array of `structs`. This should hopefully give you everything you
need in order to take things further and build your own Go applications on top
of MySQL.
