If you are starting to improve your Python development skills, the one aspect
that must be up to scratch is your ability to test your code. Unit testing your
code can help to improve the confidence you have whenever you are trying to make
any patches, bug fixes or just changes in general.

If your tests adequately test that your code behaves the way you expect it to,
whenever you make a change, you can retest and ensure that your code still
behaves the way you expect it with your incorporated changes. If the tests fail
then you know that you will have to make further changes until your tests do
pass.

In this tutorial I am going to be showing you the basics of unit testing in
Python.

## Basic Tests

Let's envision that we have a very simple python module that features a
`calc_x()` function.

```py
## mymodule.py file
def calc_x(x):
    return x + 2
```

If we wanted to test this using the `unittest` module we could do something like
so:

```py
## mymodule
import unittest
import mymodule

class MyModuleTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_calc_x(self):
        assert(mymodule.calc_x(2) == 4)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

## Output

When we run this using `python3.6 test_mymodule.py` you should see the following
output:

```py
 $ python3.6 test_mymodule.py
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK
```
