In this tutorial we'll be looking at Python's ThreadPoolExecutor. This was
originally introduced into the language in version 3.2 and provides a simple
high-level interface for asynchronously executing input/output bound tasks.

## Why Use a ThreadPoolExecutor?

ThreadPoolExecutors provide a simple abstraction around spinning up multiple
threads and using these threads to perform tasks in a concurrent fashion. Adding
threading to your application can help to drastically improve the speed of your
application when used in the right context. By using multiple threads we can
speed up applications which face an input/output based bottleneck, a good
example of this would be a web crawler.

Web crawlers typically do a lot of heavy i/o based tasks such as fetching and
parsing websites, if we were to fetch every page in a synchronous fashion you
would find the main bottleneck for your program would be the fetching of these
pages from the internet. By using something like a ThreadPoolExecutor we can
effectively mitigate this bottleneck by doing multiple fetches concurrently and
processing each page as it returns.

## Creating a ThreadPoolExecutor

The first step we need to know is how we can define our own
`ThreadPoolExecutor’s`. This is a rather simple one-liner which looks something
like so:

```py
executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3)
```

Here we instantiate an instance of our `ThreadPoolExecutor` and pass in the
maximum number of workers that we want it to have. In this case we’ve defined it
as 3 which essentially means this thread pool will only have 3 concurrent
threads that can process any jobs that we submit to it.

In order to give the threads within our `ThreadPoolExecutor` something to do we
can call the submit() function which takes in a function as its primary
parameter like so:

```py
executor.submit(myFunction())
```

## Example

In this example we put together both the creation of our `ThreadPoolExecutor`
object and the submission of tasks to this newly instantiated object. We’ll have
a very simple task function that will which will simply sum the numbers from 0
to 9 and then print out the result. Not the most cutting edge software I’m sure
you’ll agree but it serves as a fairly adequate example.

Below our defined task function we have our standard main function. It’s within
this that we define our executor object in a similar fashion to above before
then submitting two tasks to this new pool of threads.

```py
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import threading
import random

def task():
    print("Executing our Task")
    result = 0
    i = 0
    for i in range(10):
        result = result + i
    print("I: {}".format(result))
    print("Task Executed {}".format(threading.current_thread()))

def main():
    executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3)
    task1 = executor.submit(task)
    task2 = executor.submit(task)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Output

If we were to execute our Python program above then we should see the rather
bland output of both our tasks being executed and the result of our computation
being printed out on the command line.

We then utilize the `threading.current_thread()` function in order to determine
which thread has performed this task. You should see that the two values
outputted are distinct daemon threads.

```py
$ python3.6 05_threadPool.py
Executing our Task
I: 45
Executing our Task
I: 45
Task Executed <Thread(<concurrent.futures.thread.ThreadPoolExecutor object at 0x102abf358>_1, started daemon 123145333858304)>
Task Executed <Thread(<concurrent.futures.thread.ThreadPoolExecutor object at 0x102abf358>_0, started daemon 123145328603136)>
```

## Context Manager

The second and possibly most popular method of instantiating a
ThreadPoolExecutor is using it as a context manager like so:

```py
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
```

It does much the same job as the previous method we looked at but syntactically
it looks better and can be advantageous to us as the developers in certain
scenarios.

Context managers, if you haven’t encountered them before are an incredibly
powerful concept with Python that allow us to write more syntactically beautiful
code.

## Example

This time we’ll be defining a different task that takes in a variable ‘n’ as
input just to give you a simple demonstration of how we can do this. The task
function just prints out that it’s processing ‘n’ and nothing more.

Within our main function we utilize our ThreadPoolExecutor as a context manager
and then call future = executor.submit(task, (n)) 3 times in order to give our
threadpool something to do.

```py
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def task(n):
 print("Processing {}".format(n))

def main():
 print("Starting ThreadPoolExecutor")
 with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
   future = executor.submit(task, (2))
   future = executor.submit(task, (3))
   future = executor.submit(task, (4))
 print("All tasks complete")

if __name__ == '__main__':
 main()
```

## Output

When we execute the above program you should see that it prints out that we are
starting out ThreadPoolExecutor before going on to execute the three distinct
tasks we submit to it and then finally printing out that all tasks are complete.

```py
 $ python3.6 01_threadPoolExe.py
Starting ThreadPoolExecutor
Processing 2
Processing 3
Processing 4
All tasks complete
```

## Conclusion

I hope this tutorial demystified the art of working with ThreadPoolExecutor's in
Python. If you want to learn more about how threads work in Python then I
