Asyncio became part of the Python ecosystem in version 3.4 and has since then
become the basis for a huge number of Python libraries and frameworks due to
it's impressive speed and ease of use. Asyncio allows you to easily write
single-threaded concurrent programs that utilize something called coroutines,
these coroutines are like a stripped down threads and don't come with the same
inherit performance issues that your full-fat threads would typically come with.

Asyncio also does a very good job of abstracting away from us the complexities
of things such as multiplexing I/O access over sockets and it also simplifies
our jobs by providing an arsenal of synchronization primitives that enable us to
make our programs thread-safe.

## Getting Started

In order to get started with asyncio we require one crucial component, that is
an event loop. All asyncio based systems require an event loop, this is the crux
of our programs performance. The event loop schedules our `asyncio.coroutines`
and handles all of the heavy lifting.

We can define an event loop that will simply execute on coroutine like so:

```py
import asyncio

async def myCoroutine():
    print("Simple Event Loop Example")

def main():
    ## Define an instance of an event loop
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    ## Tell this event loop to run until all the tasks assigned
    ## to it are complete. In this example just the execution of
    ## our myCoroutine() coroutine.
    loop.run_until_complete(myCoroutine())
    ## Tidying up our loop by calling close()
    loop.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

When you run this you should see that our `myCoroutine()` successfully executes.
Now at this point you must be asking, this doesn't give us anything but extra
code, what's the fuss all about? Well for this example it doesn't provide much
benefit, however in more complex scenarios, that's when we really see the true
performance benefits.

## Coroutines

So these `coroutines` are essentially lightweight versions of your more
traditional threads. By using these we essentially enable ourselves to write
asynchronous programs that are very similar to threads but they run on top of a
single thread. We can define `coroutines` in 2 distinct ways.

```py
import asyncio

async def myFunc1():
    print("Coroutine 1")

@asyncio.coroutine
def myFunc2()
    print("Coroutine 2")
```

The first method was introduced in Python 3.5 and I would tend to push you
towards using this method over the latter.

## Futures

Futures in asyncio are very much similar to the `Future` objects you would see
within Python `ThreadPoolExecutors` or `ProcessPoolExecutors` and tt follows an
almost identical implementation. Future objects are created with the intention
that they will eventually be given a result some time in the future, hence the
name. This is beneficial as it means that within your Python program you can go
off and perform other tasks whilst you are waiting for your `Future` to return a
result.

Thankfully working with Futures in asyncio is relatively easy thanks to the
`ensure_future()` method which takes in a `coroutine` and returns the `Future`
version of that `coroutine`.

```py
import asyncio

## Define a coroutine that takes in a future
async def myCoroutine(future):
    ## simulate some 'work'
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    ## set the result of our future object
    future.set_result("My Coroutine-turned-future has completed")

async def main():
    ## define a future object
    future = asyncio.Future()
    ## wait for the completion of our coroutine that we've
    ## turned into a future object using the ensure_future() function
    await asyncio.ensure_future(myCoroutine(future))
    ## Print the result of our future
    print(future.result())

## Spin up a quick and simple event loop
## and run until completed
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
try:
    loop.run_until_complete(main())
finally:
    loop.close()
```

If you were to run this you should see that our program successfully turns our
`coroutine` into a `future` object and prints out the result.

## Multiple Coroutines

Let's now try to take advantage of asyncio's ability to run multiple coroutines
concurrently. This will hopefully give you some idea as to how powerful
`asyncio` is and how you can use it to effectively create incredibly performant
Python programs running on a single-thread.

Let's start by creating a simple coroutine that takes in an `id` as its primary
parameter. This will generate a random integer called `process_length` and wait
for that length of time. It will then print out it's `id` and how long it
awaited for.

Next within our `main()` method we will generate 10 tasks that and then await
these tasks completion using the `await asyncio.gather()` function, passing in
our list of `tasks`. Finally we'll utilize the same event loop from the previous
example in order to run our `asyncio` program.

```py
import asyncio
import random

async def myCoroutine(id):
    process_time = random.randint(1,5)
    await asyncio.sleep(process_time)
    print("Coroutine: {}, has successfully completed after {} seconds".format(id, process_time))

async def main():
    tasks = []
    for i in range(10):
        tasks.append(asyncio.ensure_future(myCoroutine(i)))

    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)


loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
try:
    loop.run_until_complete(main())
finally:
    loop.close()
```

When you run this you should see something like so:

```py
 $ python3.6 getting-started-asyncio.py
Coroutine: 4, has successfully completed after 1 seconds
Coroutine: 7, has successfully completed after 2 seconds
Coroutine: 8, has successfully completed after 2 seconds
Coroutine: 0, has successfully completed after 3 seconds
Coroutine: 1, has successfully completed after 3 seconds
Coroutine: 2, has successfully completed after 4 seconds
Coroutine: 6, has successfully completed after 4 seconds
Coroutine: 3, has successfully completed after 5 seconds
Coroutine: 5, has successfully completed after 5 seconds
Coroutine: 9, has successfully completed after 5 seconds
```

Our coroutines go off and execute concurrently and finish execution at different
times. It's important to note that these are not completed in the same order as
they were submitted and if you were to time the execution of the above program,
it would take just above 5 seconds to complete execution.

## Conclusion

This was just a very quick and simple introduction to the `asyncio` framework.
We'll be covering this framework in more detail in future tutorials.
