> This tutorial was built using Python 3.6

Maps in Python are syntactic sugar that allow you to very succinctly iterate
through every element of an array and perform a function on it.

Imagine we started off with a list of values numbering from 2-6 like so:

```python
values = [2,3,4,5,6]
```

And we had a function which doubled said values:

```python
def double(x):
  return x * 2
```

Without the use of maps we would have to do something like so in order to
multiply every element:

```python
for value in values:
  value = double(value)
```

but with maps we can be far more succinct:

```python
results = list(map(double, values))
```

### Complete Example

Below you'll find a complete exmaple for a simple map which applies the double
function to every element in the values array.

```python
values = [2,3,4,5,6]

def double(x):
  return x * 2

results = list(map(double, values))
print(results)
```

this produces the following output:

```python
[4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]
```
