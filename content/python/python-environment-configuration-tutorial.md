Defining a solid strategy for handling various environment configuration in your
Python programs can drastically improve the way you deploy and manage different
environments.

In the most basic of scenarios we would typically have 2 main environments,
`development` and `production`. In our development environment we would do both
our development and testing against the likes of non-production based databases
and resources in order to prevent adding noise to our `production` environment.

In some scenarios you may have to pick up various environment variables from the
machine running your Python application. In this tutorial I'm going to be
showing you the best ways to access these environment variables.

## Basic Example

Say we had a section of code that talks to a database. In `development` we would
want it to talk to our `development`-only database, in `production` we would
want it to talk to our larger `production` database. We may have code that looks
like this:

```python
import MySQLdb

db = MySQLdb.connect("localhost", "devuser", "devpass", "devdatabase")
```

When we want to push to production you may want to update the connection details
to your production database and credentials. But doing this every time you make
a release to production can be time-consuming and error-prone. What happens if
we forget when we are deploying and our `production` environment ends up hitting
a `development` database? In some scenarios this could be disastrous and cost
millions in damages.

So how do we do this using environment variables?

## System Environment Variables

If we had two distinct servers to run our Python applications, we could set the
environment variables `db_username` and `db_password` on each of our servers.

When our application starts up it would pick up our `db_username` and
`db_password` environment variables and connect to the database using the
appropriate credentials.

These are environment variables that can be read using the `os` module. If we
wanted to read all of our environment variables we could use `os.environ` like
so:

```py
>>> import os
>>> print(os.environ)
environ({'VAR1': 'value1', ...})
```

If we wanted to read in our `db_username` and `db_password` environment
variables only then we could use the `os.getenv()` function. This takes in 2
parameters, the first being the name of the environment variable we wish to
retrieve and the second being a `default` value that is returned if no
environment variable can be found.

```py
>>> import os
>>> db_username = os.getenv('db_username', 'NULL')
>>> db_password = os.getenv('db_password', 'NULL')
```

This solution works if you can set distinct variables in the environments that
you run your Python applications. However this approach could be difficult if
you run on one shared machine without the use of virtual machines, containers or
some other similar mechanism.

## Docker

If you haven't heard of Docker then I highly suggest you check it out.
Essentially it's a containerization technology that allows you to wrap your
applications in a container. This container features everything that your app
needs to run and can subsequently be deployed on any operating system also
running Docker.

Within these containers you would typically set `environment` variables that
contained things such as database `usernames` and `passwords`. Your application
would then pick these up at runtime and use these credentials to connect to the
appropriate database.

## Conclusion

Hopefully this article helped to shed some light on how you would go about
working with environment variables in your Python applications. If you found
