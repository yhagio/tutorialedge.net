## Variables in Python

Let’s first have a look at variables. A variable is essentially a place where we
can store the value of something for processing later on. Imagine you wanted to
write a program that doubled a number for us, not the most exciting of programs
I know but it is a good example.

We would first want to define a variable to store our number, double it and then
print it out.

Open up visual studio code and create a new python file called double.py. In
this double.py file you will want to add the following code:

```py
my_number = 2
print(my_number)

my_number = my_number * 2
print(my_number)
```

We start off by defining a new variable called `my_number` and setting this new
variable to equal 2. After this we then print out the value of our variable
using the `print` function and passing in what we wish to `print`, in this case
we wish to print our `my_number` variable.

When you run this you should see the number 2 being printed out in the console.

```py
>>> my_number = 2
>>> print(my_number)
2
```

After this we then re-assign our my_number variable to equal the current value
of my_number times 2. This doubles our starting number. When we now run this
program you should see the number 4 being printed out below our 2 value.

```py
>>> my_number = 2
>>> print(my_number)
2
>>> my_number = my_number * 2
>>> print(my_number)
4
```

> **Exercise** - Try changing the my_number variable to a series of different
> numbers to test this out.

Now this example may work with numeric values, but what happens if we want to
define a variable that stores something like a name? We can do that to simply by
choosing a variable name such as first_name and then setting this to equal the
string of our choice surrounded by quotes like so:

```py
first_name = "Elliot"
print(first_name)
```

We can then do cool things like printing out custom messages like this:

```py
print("Welcome: " + first_name)
```

This should then print out `Welcome: Elliot` to our console when we run it.

## Functions in Python

So now that we’ve got a basic understanding of variables in Python, let’s now
move on to functions. If you’ve never encountered functions before then you can
think of them as blocks of instructions, imagine you had a maths program that
could either double or triple a number of your choice. You would want to define
two distinct functions that would take in a number and either double or triple
it.

In order to define functions in python we can use the def keyword followed by
the name of the function we wish to define like so:

```py
def double(my_number):
```

This is known as a function declaration and it’s below this function declaration
that we’ll define what we want our function to do. You should notice that we’ve
included `(my_number)` beside our function, this is how we define what goes into
every function. In this case we want it to take in a `my_number` variable which
we will then go on to double within our function.

```py
def double(my_number):
    return my_number * 2
```

> Note: we have used the `return` keyword which returns the value of
> `my_number * 2` whenever this function is called.

If we then wished to use this function then we could do something like this:

```py
def double(my_number):
    return my_number * 2

## create a new variable called `my_var` which equals
## the value returned by calling double() on the value 5.
my_var = double(5)
## print our new `my_var`
print(my_var)
```

> **Exercise** - Try implementing a triple function that takes in a `my_number`
> variable and returns triple this value.

### Further Examples

In the previous example we defined a pretty small function that only featured
one line of code within its body. It's important to note however that you can
define many lines of code within your function and even call other functions
from within your own function. There is also no rule that states you `must`
return something from within your function. It could, for example, just perform
a series of print statements like so:

```py
def test_function():
    print("Hello World")
    print("This is a multi-line function")
    print("that does not return anything")
```
