The reactive programmingÂ paradigm is something that I've always been interested
in upon learning about them when working with RxJS in my Angular 2+ based
projects.

Event based systems can dynamically react to different situations in smart ways
and the [ReactiveX](https://github.com/ReactiveX) library enables to do this in
a such a way that our code is succinct and easy to follow.

## Differences between Reactive and Event-Driven Programming

It should be noted that there are some subtle differences between both
event-driven programming and that of reactive programming. Event-driven
programming focuses on handling events such as, for example, a button click and
is the paradigm that most operating systems are based upon. If you perform an
action within an operating system, the `os` will treat that as an event and
trigger the corresponding function for that action.

Reactive programming on the other hand treats data passed into reactive systems
as events. You could have a reactive system listen for stock price changes and
only trigger an action to happen when a stock reaches a certain price.

## Working with RxPY

In this tutorial we'll be exploring the
[RxPY](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY) library which is the most popular
library currently available for writing reactive systems.

To get us started we are going to want to define an input stream that we'll
subsequently watch and then trigger actions should one of these bits of data
meet a certain criteria.

Let's imagine that we are creating a stock trading system that will buy and sell
stocks depending on their price. We could have an array of stocks like so:

```py
stocks = [
  { 'TCKR' : 'APPL', 'PRICE': 200},
  { 'TCKR' : 'GOOG', 'PRICE': 90},
  { 'TCKR' : 'TSLA', 'PRICE': 120},
  { 'TCKR' : 'MSFT', 'PRICE': 150},
  { 'TCKR' : 'INTL', 'PRICE': 70},
]
```

We then want to create an `Observable` object that will emit events based on
what the value of the stocks are. In this example we'll define a
`buy_stock_events(observer)` function which will iterate over our `stocks` array
and call the `on_next()` function whenever the stock price is greater than
`100`.

```py
from rx import Observable

stocks = [
  { 'TCKR' : 'APPL', 'PRICE': 200},
  { 'TCKR' : 'GOOG', 'PRICE': 90},
  { 'TCKR' : 'TSLA', 'PRICE': 120},
  { 'TCKR' : 'MSFT', 'PRICE': 150},
  { 'TCKR' : 'INTL', 'PRICE': 70},
  { 'TCKR' : 'ELLT', 'PRICE': 0}
]

def buy_stock_events(observer):
  for stock in stocks:
    if(stock['PRICE'] > 100):
      observer.on_next(stock['TCKR'])
    elif(stock['PRICE'] <= 0):
      observer.on_error(stock['TCKR'])
  observer.on_completed()

source = Observable.create(buy_stock_events)
```

Once we have done this we can then subscribe to our `source` Observable object
like so:

```py
source.subscribe(on_next=lambda value: print("Received Instruction to buy {0}".format(value)),
                on_completed=lambda: print("Completed trades"),
                on_error=lambda e: print(e))
```

You'll notice that we are passing in 3 distinct `lambda` functions into our call
to `subscribe()`. These 3 `lambda` functions are `on_next()` which is called
whenever our Observable emits something, `on_completed()` which is called when
our Observable has nothing else to give us, and `on_error()` which is called
whenever there is an error emitted by our Observable.

## The Output

When you run this you should see that `APPL`, `TSLA` and `MSFT` all trigger our
observer's `on_next()` function and a buy order is placed. However, when our
Observable tries to process `ELLT` it calls `on_error()` as the stock price is
set to `0`.

```py
 $ python3.6 allLambda.py
Received Instruction to buy APPL
Received Instruction to buy TSLA
Received Instruction to buy MSFT
Stock has an invalid price: ELLT
```

## Conclusion

This is just a very simple example of what could be done with `RxPY`, there are
an almost infinite amount of different things you could do with this library.
You could for instance have a Twitter bot scan for tweets based on a certain
keyword and whenever a new tweet appears it could trigger an event. Or you could
expand out this wonderfully complex trading algorithm shown above and create a
system that has the potential to buy you a luxury yacht somewhere warm!
