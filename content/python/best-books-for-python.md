# Learn Python the Hard Way

</div>

Learn Python the hard way focuses on teaching you Python by having you work through problems and actually writing code which I feel is the only real way to learn any new language. This is ideal for those who aren't yet experienced in the art of programming as it guides you through things like setting up your environment, code organization and other fundamental programming paradigms. 

# Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner

</div>

This book is, as the title suggests, is aimed at people who are entirely new to programming and want to learn their first programming language. It presents a solid introduction to the language and basic principles and much like Learn Python the Hard Way, it will have you working on real-life scenarios. Each chapter features a small game at the end that demonstrates the key elements of that chapter as well as a set of questions for you to test your knowledge.

# Python Crash Course

<p><img alt="Python Crash Course" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/images.tutorialedge.net/books/python-crash-course.jpg" class="book-img" />A fast paced but comprehensive introduction to programming with python, Python Crash Course is another superb book to add to your library and help you finally master Python. </p>

## What it Covers

Throughout the course of this book you'll start off learning the fundamentals of the Python programming language and then you'll be asked to build 3 different applications:

* A Space invaders-inspired arcade game
* Data visualizations
* A simple web app

It's easy to read and I'd highly recommend this to anyone new to the language.
