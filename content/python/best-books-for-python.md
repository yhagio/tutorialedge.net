widely regarded as one of the best languages to learn first if you are wanting
to get into computer programming.

## Dive Into Python

Dive into Python is a perfect hands-on guide for experienced programmers to come
to grips with the Python programming language. It's succinct in the way it
delivers its content and is an excellent reference book that's definitely handy
to have close at hand when programming.

## Learn Python the Hard Way

</div>

Learn Python the hard way focuses on teaching you Python by having you work
through problems and actually writing code which I feel is the only real way to
learn any new language. This is ideal for those who aren't yet experienced in
the art of programming as it guides you through things like setting up your
environment, code organization and other fundamental programming paradigms.

## Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner

</div>

This book is, as the title suggests, is aimed at people who are entirely new to
programming and want to learn their first programming language. It presents a
solid introduction to the language and basic principles and much like Learn
Python the Hard Way, it will have you working on real-life scenarios. Each
chapter features a small game at the end that demonstrates the key elements of
that chapter as well as a set of questions for you to test your knowledge.

## Python Crash Course

<p><img alt="Python Crash Course" src="https://images.tutorialedge.net/books/python-crash-course.jpg" class="book-img" />A fast paced but comprehensive introduction to programming with python, Python Crash Course is another superb book to add to your library and help you finally master Python. </p>

### What it Covers

Throughout the course of this book you'll start off learning the fundamentals of
the Python programming language and then you'll be asked to build 3 different
applications:

- A Space invaders-inspired arcade game
- Data visualizations
- A simple web app

It's easy to read and I'd highly recommend this to anyone new to the language.
