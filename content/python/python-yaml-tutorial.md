Yaml has quickly become one of the defacto data formats used when it comes to storing information and configuration.

In this tutorial, we will be looking at how you can effectively work with yaml in your Python applications. More specifically, we will be covering the following:

- ✅ How to read Yaml files and access values 
- ✅ How to update and write to your own Yaml files
- ✅ How to navigate a more complex yaml file structure with loops and nested structures

# Reading Yaml Files

Let's start off by looking at how we can read the contents of a yaml file and access a few simple values. 

<div class="filename"> main.py </div>

```py
import yaml

def main():
    read_yaml_file()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Let's take a look at

<div class="filename"> $ python main.py </div>

```output
output...
```
