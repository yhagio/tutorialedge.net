> This tutorial was built using Python 3.6

In this tutorial we'll be looking at what `iterators` are with Python. We'll
also be looking at how we can effectively work with them and improve our Python
programs using them.

## What Are Iterators?

Iterators are cool in the sense that they allow us to step over every item in an
array, object or file and perform work on each item. For example, we could take
the string `test` and use an iterator to step over every character element
within that string.

```python
>>> string = "test"

>>> for character in string:
>>>    print(character)

## Output
t
e
s
t
```

## Iterables

`Iterables` in Python represent something that we can actively iterate over.
These are things like `lists`, `sets` and even `strings` as we've seen in the
previous demonstration. If we wish to turn an `iterable` into an `iterator` then
we can use the `iter` built in function which takes in the `iterable` like so:

```python
>>> string = "test"
>>> iterator = iter(string)
>>> iterator = iter(string)
>>> print(iterator.next())
t
>>> print(iterator.next())
e
>>> print(iterator.next())
s
>>> print(iterator.next())
t
```

## The `next()` Method

When we have an `iterator` object we can effectively step through it using the
`next()` method. This will simply return the next element of the given
`iterator` object, if no further elements exist in the `iterator` then a
`StopIteration` exception will be raised:

```python
>>> iterator = iter(string)
>>> print(iterator.next())
t
>>> print(iterator.next())
e
>>> print(iterator.next())
s
>>> print(iterator.next())
t
>>> print(iterator.next())
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration
```
