In this tutorial I will be showing you how you can fetch the a webpage using the
`urllib2` python module. This is a relatively simple process that can be
accomplished in 5 lines of code.

## The Imports

To begin with we will need to import the `urllib2` python module so that we can
utilize it's functionality:

```py
import urllib2
```

## Fetching a Website

<p>Once we've imported all the appropriate python modules we can move onto fetching our desired webpage. For the purpose of this example we'll be fetching this webpage and we can do that like so:</p>

```py
req = urllib2.Request('http://www.tutorialedge.net/python/fetching-web-pages-python/')
response = urllib2.urlopen(req)
the_page = response.read()
## Here we print out the retrieved page's HTML to the console
## once we've got this we can start performing some analysis of
## the webpage and do some cooler things.
print(the_page)
```

<p>Now in order to prevent being hit by 403 forbidden responses we need to define a set of headers for our HTTP request.</p>

```py
import urllib2

## create a variable which will hold our desired web page as a string
site= "http://tutorialedge.net"
## create the approprriate headers for our http request so that we wont run
## into any 403 forbidden errors. All of this will be available at the tutorial
## page that I will link to in the description below
hdr = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.11 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/23.0.1271.64 Safari/537.11',
       'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8',
       'Accept-Charset': 'ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3',
       'Accept-Encoding': 'none',
       'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.8',
       'Connection': 'keep-alive'}

## Perform a HTTP request by passing in our desired URL and setting our headers to equal
## the headers that we've defined above.
req = urllib2.Request(site, headers=hdr)

#
try:
    ## here we are going to open our desired page using urllib2.urlopen
    ## and passing in our request object as a parameter and as a means of protection we
    ## will surround this with a try except so that, should the script run into any errors
    ## it will fail gracefully instead of just crashing.
    page = urllib2.urlopen(req)
except urllib2.HTTPError, e:
    ## print out the HTTPError
    print e.fp.read()

## lastly we will want to read the response which was generated by opening
## the url and store it under content
content = page.read()
## and then print out this page.
print content
```
