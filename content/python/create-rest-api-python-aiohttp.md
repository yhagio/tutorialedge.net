In this tutorial we'll be building a very simple RESTful based API using
[aio-libs/aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) which is an asynchronous
http client/server framework.

## Getting Started with aiohttp

Before we go into how we can use aiohttp to create a simple RESTful API, it's
important to know exactly what the framework is and what it can do for us. To
start with, it features excellent support of the HTTP protocol as well as for
websockets which makes it ideal for working with popular websocket libraries
such as Socket.io. If you are interested in seeing how to implement a simple
client/server socketio based solution check out this tutorial:
[Python Socket.io with aiohttp Tutorial](/python/python-socket-io-tutorial/).

The key part of the aiohttp framework is that it works in an asynchronous
manner, it can concurrently handle hundreds of requests per second without too
much hassle. In comparison to frameworks such as flask, it's incredibly
performant.

### Installing aiohttp

In order to install aiohttp you can run the following `pip` command:

```py
pip install aiohttp
```

## Writing a Simple API

To get us started writing a simple API we are going to write a handler function;
`async def handle(request):` which will return a `json` based response whenever
it is called. We'll then create an `app` object by calling
`app = web.Application()` and then we'll set up our app's router and add a `GET`
request endpoint that calls `handle` whenever `"/"` is hit. Finally we call
`web.run_app(app)` in order to kick off our newly defined `aiohttp` API.

```py
## filename: app.py

from aiohttp import web
import json

async def handle(request):
    response_obj = { 'status' : 'success' }
    return web.Response(text=json.dumps(response_obj))

app = web.Application()
app.router.add_get('/', handle)

web.run_app(app)
```

## Testing our API

We can then run our new REST API by calling `python app.py` which should start
our app on `http://0.0.0.0` a.k.a `http://localhost` on port `8080` by default.

```py
 $ python3.6 app.py
======== Running on http://0.0.0.0 ========
(Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

When you navigate to `http://localhost:8080` you should see our
`{"status": "success"}` being returned in the browser.

## POST Requests and Query Parameters

Now that we've successfully defined a very basic, single `endpoint` API we can
now start to build on top of this and start exposing different routes that use
different verbs. Let's create a simple `POST` request endpoint that takes in
`name` via a query parameter. We'll want the final URL of this endpoint to look
like so: `http://localhost:8080/user?name=elliot`. Let's define the handler
function `new_user(request)` now.

```py
async def new_user(request):
    try:
        ## happy path where name is set
        user = request.query['name']
        ## Process our new user
        print("Creating new user with name: " , user)

        response_obj = { 'status' : 'success' }
        ## return a success json response with status code 200 i.e. 'OK'
        return web.Response(text=json.dumps(response_obj), status=200)
    except Exception as e:
        ## Bad path where name is not set
        response_obj = { 'status' : 'failed', 'reason': str(e) }
        ## return failed with a status code of 500 i.e. 'Server Error'
        return web.Response(text=json.dumps(response_obj), status=500)
```

Once we have successfully defined this new handler function we will have to
register it in our routes like so:

```py
app.router.add_post('/user', new_user)
```

Try run your application now and send a `POST` request to
`http://localhost:8080/user?name=test` and you should see the following output
in the console:

```py
 $ python3.6 app.py
======== Running on http://0.0.0.0 ========
(Press CTRL+C to quit)
Creating new user with name:  test
```

You should also receive the same success json as well as a `200` status.
