Hello fellow devs! In this article, we'll be looking at some of the potential questions you may
be asked within a Python coding interview. This is in no way a comprehensive list, but it should
give you some additional practice if you are looking to sharpen your skills/knowledge before 
going into some interviews.

## Question 1

> **Question** - Explain Decorators and How You Would Implement A Simple Decorator

### Answer

Functions in Python are first class objects which can subsequently be passed around within your applications 
as if they were a standard variable or list. This allows us to create functions which take in functions and 
subsequently wrap a call to a function with anything we want.

Let's have a look at a simple example in which we create a `@my_decorator` decorator which will wrap a function
with a couple of print statements:

```py
def my_decorator(func):
    print("Wrapping a Decorator")
    func()
    print("Finished wrapping a Decorator")

@my_decorator
def hello_world():
    print("Hello World")

hello_world()
```

You'll notice that when we run this program. When our `hello_world()` function is called
it will attempt to run our function, but along with the `print` statements defined within
our `my_decorator()` function.

```s
$ python3 main.py
wrapping a decorator
hello world
finished wrapping a decorator
```
