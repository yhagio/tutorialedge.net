Understanding the way and the order in which Python resolves functions is
important. You need to know where your code is going to call, when you call it
and things can get messy as soon as you start playing with classes inheriting
from multiple other classes.

In this tutorial we'll be looking at how Python 3 handles its `MRO` by using a
little something called `C3 Linearization`.

## The Problems with Inheritance

Imagine you were implementing a programming language that featured inheritance.
When you first approach this topic you decide: a child class will have all of
the functions and attributes that it's parent classes should have!

Now this may work for the vast majority of scenarios but what would happen if
two parent classes both implemented the same function or attribute? How do you
decide what function or attribute takes precedence?

> This is known as the diamond problem. Some languages such as Scala, use an
> algorithm called `right-first depth-first search` to solve this. Python 3 uses
> the `C3 linearization algorithm`.

## A Pratical Example

Let's take a look at how `Method Resolution Order` or `MRO` works in real-terms
with a very simple Python program. We'll define 2 classes that inherit nothing,
and a third which inherits both.

What's special about this is that the 2 classes our `my_super_class` class
inherits from both define a `test_func(self)` function.

What happens when we run this code?

```py
class awesome_class():

    def __init__(self):
        print("My Awesome Class")

    def test_func(self):
        print("This is my awesome class")

class not_so_awesome_class():

    def __init__(self):
        print("My Not So Awesome Class")

    def test_func(self):
        print("This is my not so awesome class")

class my_super_class(awesome_class, not_so_awesome_class):

    def __init__(self):
        print("My Super Class")

my_class = my_super_class()
my_class.test_func()
```

### Output

When we run the above code you should see that the `__init__` function is called
of our `my_super_class` class. It then calls the inherited `test_func(self)`
function from the its inherited `awesome_class`.

```py
 $ python3.6 test.py
My Super Class
This is my awesome class
```

If we were to switch the order in which our `my_super_class` inherits then
you'll see that the `test_func()` from the `not_so_awesome_class` is called
instead. Key takeaway from this point is that ordering of inheritance matters.

## C3 Linearization

Let's now have a look at this `C3 superclass linearization` algorithm and how it
works. We can define it as so:

> The `C3 Superclass Linearization` of a class is the sum of the class plus a
> unique merge of the linearizations of its parents and a list of the parents
> itself.

This may not mean a lot to most people, so let's try and demystify what all this
means by breaking it down.

`C3` does the following:

- It guarantees that base class declaration is preserved
- It guarantees that subclasses appear before base classes
- It guarantees that for every class in a graph of all inherited classes, they
  adhere to the previous two points

## An Example

Let's have a look at the following class inheritance graph from the algo's wiki:

![C3 Linearization Graph](https://images.tutorialedge.net/images/c3-linearization.png)

Basically in this graph `class O` does not have any parents and features a
number of children: `[A, B, C, D, E]`. Our `[A, B, C]` classes are the parents
to `K1`, `[D, B, E]` for `K2` and `[D, A]` for `K3`. Finally class `Z` extends
from `[K1, K2, K3]`.

This represents a fairly complex dependency graph and not typically
representative of "normal" systems, however it gives us lots of examples to
dissect how `C3` works.

Let's start breaking this down:

| Class   | Linearization                                | Comments                                                                                                            |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `L(O)`  | [0]                                          | This is relatively trivial and would be [0] as it has no parents                                                    |
| `L(A)`  | [A] + merge(l[O], [O])                       | The linearization of A is A plus the merge of its parent's,                                                         |
|         | [A, O]                                       | Thus the final linearization equals [A,O]                                                                           |
| `L(B)`  | [B, O]                                       | `[B, C, D, E]` all have very similar linearizations                                                                 |
| `L(K1)` | [K1] + merge(L(A), L(B), L(C), [A,B,C])      | First we need to find the linearizations of `K1`'s parents, [A, B, C] and merge them with the parent list [A, B, C] |
|         | [K1] + merge([A,O], [B,O, [C,O], [A,B,C]])   | Class A is a good candidate as it is the head of the parent list                                                    |
|         | [K1, A] + merge([O], [B, O], [C, O], [B, C]) | We shouldn't choose class `O` here as it appears in the tails of list 2 and 3, the next suitable class is `B`       |
|         | [K1, A, B] + merge([O], [O], [C,O], [C])     | Again `O` is not a good candidate, we now go with `C`                                                               |
|         | [K1, A, B, C] + merge([O], [O], [O])         | Finally we have to choose class O as all other options are exhausted                                                |
|         | [K1, A, B, C, O]                             | Our final solution                                                                                                  |

> Exercise: Work out the linearization of `L(Z)` based on examples above.
