In this tutorial I'm aiming to help demystify this concept of generators within
the Python programming language. We'll look at what generators are and how we
can utilize them within our python programs.

## What Are Generators?

Generators are functions that can return multiple values at different times.
These are [iterators](/python/python-iterator-tutorial/) that we can
subsequently iterate over in a variety of different ways.

Imagine we wanted to define a function that would return double the value of
whatever we first passed into it. If we wanted to do this with normal python
functions we would have to do something like this:

```python
def my_func(x):
    return x*2
```

However this function would return the value of `x` doubled only once. However
with generators we could make it double every time we called the `next()`
function on this particular generator. This is where the `yield` keyword comes
into play. You can think of `yield` in a similar way to how you would think of
`return` in a normal function. Except you can call `yield` as many times as you
would like.

Let's define a very simple generator that will double the value of whatever we
pass into it a grand total of three times, so if we pass 2 into it, by the final
call we should end up with a value of 16.

```python
def my_generator(x):
    yield x*2
    yield x*4
    yield x*8
```

## Complete Code Snippet

Let's flesh this out into a full python script. In this we have our new
generator function with it's 3 `yield` statements, below that we declare an
instance of our generator by calling `mygen = my_generator(2)`. We then print
out the `next(mygen)` value 3 different times to the console.

```python

def my_generator(x):
    yield x*2
    yield x*4
    yield x*8

mygen = my_generator(2)

print(next(mygen))
print(next(mygen))
print(next(mygen))
```

### Output

If we were then to run this code and call the `next()` function 3 times on this
generator, you should see the value is doubled every time. The above code should
then print out the following in the console:

```bash
$ python3.6 generators.py
4
8
16
```

## StopIteration Error

The StopIteration error is raised when a call to next() is made and there are no
subsequent values to be yielded from our generator function. If we added a 4th
call to `print(next(mygen))` in the previous sample then you should see an error
like so print out:

```bash
 $ python3.6 generators.py
4
8
16
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "generators.py", line 12, in <module>
    print(next(mygen))
StopIteration
FAIL
```

## Infinite Generator

Let's now improve upon our original generator function. We can implement an
[iterator](/python/python-iterator-tutorial/) that continues to yield values
indefinitely. This will keep a reference of what value `x` currently is and
after every yield it will double that value.

```python
def my_generator(x):
    x = x
    while True:
        yield x*2
        x = x*2

mygen = my_generator(2)

print(next(mygen))
print(next(mygen))
print(next(mygen))
print(next(mygen))
```

## Output

We can then call the next() function as many times as we'd desire and we would
then see our original value of `x` double with each subsequent call to our
`next(mygen)` function. Try change the value passed in to `my_generator()` and
experiment with the number of times you call `print(next(mygen))`.

```bash
 $ python3.6 generators.py
4
8
16
32
```

> It's important to note that the physical limitations still apply and I'm sure
> you'd start to hit some form of limit for the above program if you called
> next() indefinitely.

## Conclusion

So, in this tutorial, we looked at generators in Python! We looked at how we can build our own Python generators and subsequently use them within our own Python applications for fame and fortune!
