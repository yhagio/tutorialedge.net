Do you fancy contributing back to the site or writing a few of your own
tutorials? Fork this entire site from our public github repo, make some changes
and then submit a pull request and I'll review it and if it meets our standards,
it'll get pushed live to the site.

# Authoring New Tutorials

Authoring a new tutorial is simple with hugo. All you have to do is create a new
`file.md` within the directory of your choice and then fill in the appropriate
meta data at the top of the file:

```t
+++
date = "2017-04-15T09:47:01+01:00"
title = "The title of your article"

desc = "A description that suits what your article is about"
tags = ["python"]
series = ["python"]
author = "Elliot Forbes"
twitter = "https://twitter.com/Elliot_F"
+++
```

## Getting Recognition

In order to be recognized for your work you simply need to change the author
field to your name and then post a link to your twitter page as shown above. For
any pages you write you'll then see your name, your twitter profile picture and
a link to your profile on the right hand sidebar.
