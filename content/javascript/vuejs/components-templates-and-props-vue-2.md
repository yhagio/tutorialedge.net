To begin, let's look at how to make a component in Vue. First, we specify the
component, like this:

```js
Vue.component("custom-article", {
  template: `
    <article>
      Our own custom article component!<span></span>
    </article>`
});
new Vue({
  el: "#app"
});
```

A component is a block of code that we give a custom name. This custom name can
be anything we come up with, and it's a single label for that entire block of
code in the form of a custom HTML tag. In the previous example, we grouped
the article and span tags and gave that custom tag the name of custom-article.

> **Note -** Components are named using kebab-case.

The code for this component is available as a Codepen
at `https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/xzpOaJ`.

Now, to create an instance of our component, we simply use
our <custom-article> opening and closing tags in our HTML, like this:

```html
<main id="app">
  <custom-article></custom-article>
</main>
```

> **Note -** Our custom-article component is referred to as the child component.
> The parent is the actual Vue instance.

Note that you can use string templates even without a component. You simply add
the template option to your Vue instance, like this:

```js
//HTML
<main id="app" />;
//JS
new Vue({
  el: "#app",
  template:
    "<article>A string template without a component!<span></span></article>"
});
```

The example code for the previous example is available
here: `https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/RJxMae`.

Next, we'll see how we can improve our component with the help
of the props and data options.

## Adding props and data for better components

To make our custom-article component more useful, we'll add a props option to
it, like this:

```js
Vue.component("custom-article", {
  props: ["content"],
  template: "<article>{{content}}</article>"
});
new Vue({
  el: "#app"
});
```

Props are a way to pass the data from the parent to the child. They are one-way
flows of data between the parent and the child. Props are always defined as an
array.

The code for the previous example is available
here: `https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/KeZNPr`.

We have registered a prop in our component, and now we can use it in HTML as an
attribute named just like our prop:

```html
<main id="app">
  <custom-article content="This component was made with the help of a prop.">
  </custom-article>
</main>
```

Props are used when we need to make smaller changes to our components without
having to make a whole new component. They help us reuse what we already have.

In the next section, we'll use the Vue instance's data object to add content to
our custom-article component.

## Adding content to our components with the help of the data object

> **Code -** The code pen for this example can be found
> at `https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/QxadmE`.

In our HTML, we'll change the code to the following:

```html
<main id="app">
  <custom-article v-bind:content="datacontent"> </custom-article>
</main>
```

In our JS, we'll update our Vue code to this:

```js
Vue.component("custom-article", {
  props: ["content"],
  template: "<article>{{content}}</article>"
});
new Vue({
  el: "#app",
  data: {
    datacontent:
      "This component was made with the help of a data object in the Vue instance"
  }
});
```

In the previous example, we are using the v-bind directive to bind
the content prop in our custom-article component to the datacontent property of
our data object.

> **Note -** If you think through this code, you will see that props are almost
> like named variables (with the prop's variable name being content in the
> example). Props simply pass to the child component whatever data they receive
> from the parent.

There is also another way we can do this. Instead of using data inside our Vue
instance, we can give it to our component; only this time it has to be a data
function. Here is the full code for this implementation:

```js
// HTML
<main id="app">
  <custom-article />
</main>;

// JS
Vue.component("custom-article", {
  template: "<article>{{datacontent}}</article>",
  data: function() {
    return {
      datacontent:
        "This component was made with the help of a data function in the Vue component called custom-article"
    };
  }
});
new Vue({
  el: "#app"
});
```

> **Note -** If we used data as an object instead of as a function, then
> reactivity would apply to all instances of our component. Since the main
> purpose of components is to be reusable, it is important to remember that in
> this case data must be a function.

Props can also be defined as objects, which allows us to give them a lot more
information: validate incoming data, set default values in case no data comes
through, and so on.

In the following example, we are stating that our custom-article component is
expecting the parent to pass it a prop named message, or type string, which is
required:

```html
// HTML
<div id="app">
  <custom-article :message-being-passed="datacontent"></custom-article>
</div>

//JS Vue.component('custom-article', { props: { messageBeingPassed: { type:
String, required: true, default: 'Hello Vue' } }, template: `
<div class="thetemplate">{{ message }}</div>
` }); new Vue({ el: "#app", data: function() { return { datacontent: 'This
component was made with the help of a data function in the Vue component called
custom-article, and the data passed was validated with the help of the props
object inside the Vue component' } } }) //CSS .thetemplate { font-size: 30px;
padding: 20px; color: limegreen; font-family: Arial; border: 3px solid green;
border-radius: 10px; }
```

> **Code-** This example is available
> at `https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/mKpxGZ`.

Let's say we commented out the datacontent property of the Vue
instance's data function. Can you guess what would happen?

In other words, what would happen if datacontent is not providing the correct
data? The child component will simply revert to its default property in
the props object.

## Other ways of building component templates in Vue

So far, we have looked at defining templates as strings (using single
or double quotes) and as template literals (using backticks). There are also
many other ways to work with component templates:

- Inline templates
- X-templates
- Render functions
- Single file components
- JSX

Most of them have their pros and cons. For example, using JSX in Vue is possible
but generally frowned upon, as it in not the Vue way of doing things. Inline
templates are made using the inline-template attribute in your HTML. If you
add type=''text/x-template'' to an HTML script tag, you will make a Vue
x-template. Here's an example:

```html
// HTML
<div id="app">
  <script type="text/x-template" id="custom-article-template">
    <p>{{ name }}</p>
  </script>
</div>

// JS Vue.component('custom-article', { template: '#custom-article-template',
props: ['name'] }) new Vue({ el: '#app' })
```

> **Codepen -** The code pen for this example is available
> here: `https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/NzXyem`.

Single-file templates are probably the most practical way of creating templates
in Vue. You keep all your HTML, JS, and styling in a single file (with
a .vue file extension), and you compile this file with a build process, such as
Webpack.

## Building a simple web page out of components

As we have seen in the previous section, there are many ways to build a
component in Vue, which might make things look more complex than they have to
be. While it is important to be aware of the versatility that Vue brings to the
various ways we can build components, in this section we will look at a simple
way to use components to build a web page.

Before we begin building out our page, one thing should be clear to us: each
component in Vue is also just another Vue instance. This means that each
component takes an options object, which has the same key value pairs as any
other Vue instance. The only difference to this rule is that the root Vue
instance has some additional options that can only be used in it.

After these introductory clarifications, let's see how a component can be added
to a Vue instance.

## Adding simple components to a Vue instance

To start off this example, we'll begin with a simple Vue instance.

In our JavaScript file, let's make the simplest possible Vue instance, with
the #app element as its entry point:

```js
new Vue({
  el: "#app",
  data: {}
});
```

Next, let's add just one div in our HTML, so that our Vue instance has an
element in our page to get access to its DOM:

```html
<div id="app"></div>
```

Now we will add another component to our JavaScript file. Let's extend our
existing JS file by adding the following code to the very top:

```js
Vue.component("the-header", {
  template: '<h1 class="header css classes go here">Our example header</h1>'
});
```

Now we can simply add the custom the-header component inside our HTML:

```html
<div id="app">
  <the-header></the-header>
</div>
```

Doing this will render Our example header text on the screen. Now that we have
seen just how easy it is to add one simple component to our Vue apps, let's add
another one to drive the point home.

We'll start by extending our JS file with another component, the-footer:

```js
Vue.component("the-header", {
  template: '<h1 class="header css classes go here">Our example header</h1>'
});

Vue.component("the-footer", {
  template: '<h1 class="footer css classes go here">Our example header</h1>'
});

//Root Instance
new Vue({
  el: "#app",
  data: {}
});
```

Of course, we need to update our HTML in order to make this work:

```html
<div id="app">
  <the-header></the-header>
  <the-footer></the-footer>
</div>
```

When naming custom components, we need to use hyphens. This is done to make sure
there are no naming collisions with regular HTML elements.

> **Codepen -** The example code for this section is available
> at `https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/qypBbz`.

Now that we understand how to add a simple component to our Vue instance, let's
practice by adding a more complex example.

## Creating a more complex page out of components in Vue

To begin, let's add a single component to our new Vue instance. This time, we
will employ the data option inside our custom component's options object.

This is the code we start with:

```js
Vue.component("the-header", {
  template: '<h1 class="h1 text-success">{{header}}</h1>',
  data: function() {
    return {
      header: "Just another simple header"
    };
  }
});

//Root Instance
new Vue({
  el: "#app",
  data: {}
});
```

In this code, we have added mustache syntax to our template. Then we have
utilized the data option to return the text, which will be interpolated in the
template. The mustache syntax tells our component to look for the header inside
our data option. The code for this example is available
here: `https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/wxpvxy`.  Next, under our header,
we'll add some Bootstrap cards.  For simplicity's sake, we'll use an existing
example from the official Bootstrap documentation, which is available at the
following
URL: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/#using-grid-markup.

The example provides the following code:

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">Special title treatment</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          With supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content.
        </p>
        <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">Special title treatment</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          With supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content.
        </p>
        <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Now let's see how we can add a single card to our example Vue webpage. This is
the code to add to our JS:

```js
Vue.component("the-card", {
  template:
    '<div class="card"><div class="card-body"><h5 class="card-title">Special title treatment</h5><p class="card-text">With supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content.</p><a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a></div></div></div>'
});
```

> **Codepen- ** The code for this stage of the development of our code is
> available here: `https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/VByYeW`.

Next, let's add our card component to our HTML. The full updated code will look
like this:

```html
<div id="app">
  <div class="container">
    <the-header></the-header>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <the-card></the-card>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <the-card></the-card>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Adding the previous code to our HTML, with the JS updates already in place as
described earlier, we will get the following result:

![](https://images.tutorialedge.net/images/javascript/vuejs/components-templates-props/image1-17.png)

We have added a single card component in our JS; however, as we can see in the
previous example, we can now reuse it in our HTML as many times as needed.

This gives us an excellent opportunity to quickly prototype complete web pages
with the help of Vue.

We can take it even one step further, as we'll see in the next section.

## Improving our Vue-based layouts with v-for

In this section, we will improve our existing web page with the help of Vue
directives.

Our specific goal is to try to use the data option in our component instance and
combine it with the powers of Vue directives to further improve our Vue apps.

> **Codepen -** The code for this section is available
> at `https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/Epoamy`.

Let's make our JS a bit easier to read with the help of the backtick ES6 JS
syntax. This syntax allows us to write JavaScript strings which span multiple
lines:

```js
Vue.component("the-header", {
  template: '<h1 class="h1 text-success">{{header}}</h1>',
  data: function() {
    return {
      header: "Just another simple header"
    };
  }
});

Vue.component("the-card", {
  template: `
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">Special title treatment</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          With supporting text below as a natural lead-in to addtional 
          content.
        </p>
        <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
      </div>
    </div>`
});

//Root Instance
new Vue({
  el: "#app",
  data: {}
});
```

Now, let's add the data option to the the-card Vue component:

```js
  data: function() {
    return {
      customCard: [{
        heading: 'John Doe',
        text: 'John.doe@acme.org'
      },
      {
        heading: 'John Doe',
        text: 'John.doe@acme.org'
      }
     ]}
  }
```

As we can see in the preceding code, we are returning a customCard array of
objects, with each object holding a specific heading and text.

Next, we can use the v-for directive in our template, like this:

```js
Vue.component('the-card', {
  template: `
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-body" v-for="customCard in customCards">
        <h5 class="card-title">{{customCard.heading}}</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          {{customCard.text}}
        </p>
        <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
      </div>
    </div>`,
```

We introduce the v-for directive in the div that has the class of card-body. We
loop through each customCard in our collection of customCards, and we
interpolate the h5 text's content with customCard.heading for each object of
our customCard array.

Finally, let's add a Bootstrap class to our HTML so that the h1 tag of our web
page is not glued to the very top of the viewport. For that, we will use
Bootstrap's spacing utilities. You can read about them
here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/spacing/.

The change in our HTML will be minimal, with just an addition of another CSS
class: mt-5.

Finally, what follows is the complete JS code for the improved page. First, we
register the main title component:

```js
//Register main title component
Vue.component("main-title-component", {
  template: '<h1 class="text-center mt-5 mb-4">{{title}}</h1>',
  data: function() {
    return {
      title: "Just another title"
    };
  }
});
```

Then we register the list group component:

```js
//Register list group component
Vue.component("list-group-component", {
  template: `
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item" v-for="item in items">{{item.description}}</li>
    </ul>`,
  data: function() {
    return {
      items: [
        {
          description: "Description one"
        },
        {
          description: "Description two"
        },
        {
          description: "Description three"
        }
      ]
    };
  }
});
```

After that, we register the card component:

```js
// Register card component
Vue.component("card-component", {
  template: `
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">{{title}}</h5>
        <p class="card-text">{{text}}</p>
        <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
      </div>
    </div>`,
  data: function() {
    return {
      title: "This is the card title",
      text: "This is the card text"
    };
  }
});
```

We also add the root instance:

```js
//root Instance
new Vue({
  el: "#app",
  data: {}
});
```

And here is the HTML:

```html
<div id="app">
  <div class="container mt-5 mb-5">
    <main-title-component></main-title-component>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <list-group-component></list-group-component>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <card-component></card-component>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

The result of adding the previous code can be seen in this screenshot:
