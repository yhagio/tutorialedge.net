The vue-router within VueJS allows you to create powerful Single Page
Applications with minimal fuss. On a traditional website, each distinct page
would constitute a request to the server to load the relevant file. So when
someone navigated to `http://myapp.com/page-1.html`, the `page-1.html` file would
be served up.

However, when navigating through a single page application, you only have see
one request made to the server which returns your entire JavaScript application.
This means you have full control over the experience your users have when
navigating through your application, you can fully control any behaviours you
wish in terms of transitions and this tends to give your site a far more dynamic
look and feel.

## Installation

In order to get started with the `vue-router` you will first have to include it
within your Vue.JS project. This can be done by either adding the `<script>` tag
with the appropriate link to your application.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue-router/dist/vue-router.js"></script>
```

Or through the use of `npm` or `yarn`:

```js
$ yarn add vue-router
$ npm install vue-router
```

> Full installation instructions can be found here:
> [Vue-Router Installation Guide](https://router.vuejs.org/en/installation.html)

## Simple Example

In order for us to render a series of distinct pages within our Single Page
Application we need to add the `<router-view/>` tag to our application. This
will render the component of our choice depending on the route that is hit.

<div class="filename">index.html</div>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>stock-tracker</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app">
      <!-- router view will display the components we want based on route -->
      <router-view></router-view>

      <!-- we can display other components around our router-view -->
      <!-- for example we could display a footer component here or a -->
      <!-- header component that displays navigation above -->
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

In order to dictate what component our `<router-view/>` component will render,
we need to define an array of routes. These represent a `path` and a
corresponding component like so:

```js
const routes = [
  { path: "/", component: HomePageComponent },
  { path: "/simple", component: SimpleComponent }
];
```

Note, the above code needs both the `HomePageComponent` and `SimpleComponent`
prior to referencing them in our `routes` array. We can then define a new
`VueRouter` which takes in our newly defined `routes` array.

```js
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes // short for `routes: routes`
});
```

And finally, once we've defined our `VueRouter`, we add it to our Vue instance
like so:

```js
const app = new Vue({
  router
}).$mount("#app");
```

Ta-da! We now have VueJS routing with 2 very simple routes.

### Navigating Our Routes

Once we have defined our routes as well as our router, we need a method of
traversing between these different routes. In order to do this, we can leverage
the `<router-link/>` component.

This `<router-link/>` component features a `to` prop which we can set to the
`path` that we wish to navigate to.

> Whilst you can use the `<a>` tag with the correct `href` specified, I would
> highly recommend using the `<router-link/>` component. More information on
> this can be found here:
> [VueJS Router Link](https://router.vuejs.org/en/api/router-link.html)

Say we wished to add a link to our `/simple` path that we defined in our above
`routes` array. We could add the following to just above or `<router-view>`
component within our `index.html`.

```html
<router-link :to="{ path: '/simple' }"></router-link>
```

When clicking on this we should see our application's `<router-view>` component
change from rendering our `HomePageComponent` to our `SimpleComponent`.

### Full Single-Page Sample

If we were to do this within a single `index.html` page then it would look
something like so:

<div class="filename">index.html</div>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <title>Document</title>
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,300italic,700,700italic"
    />
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="//cdn.rawgit.com/necolas/normalize.css/master/normalize.css"
    />
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="//cdn.rawgit.com/milligram/milligram/master/dist/milligram.min.css"
    />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app">
      <router-link :to="{ path: 'home'}">Home</router-link>
      <router-link :to="{ path: 'simple'}">Simple</router-link>

      <router-view></router-view>
    </div>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue-router/dist/vue-router.js"></script>
    <script>
      var HomePageComponent = {
        template: "<h2>Home Page</h2>"
      };

      var SimpleComponent = {
        template: "<h2>Simple Page</h2>"
      };

      const routes = [
        { path: "/home", name: "home", component: HomePageComponent },
        { path: "/simple", name: "simple", component: SimpleComponent }
      ];

      const router = new VueRouter({
        routes // short for `routes: routes`
      });

      var app = new Vue({
        components: {
          HomePageComponent: HomePageComponent,
          SimpleComponent: SimpleComponent
        },
        router
      }).$mount("#app");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

And the final project should look something like so:

![VueJS routing tutorial](https://images.tutorialedge.net/vuejs-routing-tutorial-01.png)

I threw in a bit of css for this one:

<div class="filename">style.css</div>

```css
.center {
  text-align: center;
}
.center a {
  margin: 20px;
}
.center h2 {
  margin-top: 40px;
}
.container {
  margin-top: 80px;
}
```

## Vue CLI Configuration

When using the `vue cli`, we can define that a router is set up for us on
creation of our project.

## Conclusion

Hopefully, you found this tutorial helpful. We have managed to set up a simple
VueJS application that features routing with several routes, each displaying
differing components.
