In this tutorial, we are going to explore how we can use animations and
transitions to make our VueJS web application really stand out from the crowd.

## A Simple Transition

Let's start of by creating a few very simple transitions, these will simply fade
in when a certain condition is met. I was watching Mission Impossible whilst
writing this so the theme for this is a top secret mission. The finished product
for this section is going to look something like this:

So, if we break this down this shouldn't look as intimidating. We have 3 buttons
within a div that when clicked basically flip a boolean value. When this is
flipped, it triggers a transition in the black background `div` below.

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary" v-if="!show" v-on:click="show = !show">
  Show Mission
</button>
<button
  class="btn btn-primary"
  v-if="show && !accepted && !declined"
  v-on:click="accepted = true"
>
  Accept Mission
</button>
<button
  class="btn btn-warning"
  v-if="show && !declined && !accepted"
  v-on:click="declined = true"
>
  Decline Mission
</button>
```

These all have a `v-if` directive attached to them to dictate when they are to
show. Below these buttons we have 3 distinct `<transition/>` wrapper components.
These `<transition/>` components allow you to enter/leave transitions when you
are doing things like `v-if`, `v-show`, using dynamic components or in component
root nodes.

```html
<transition name="fade">
  <p v-if="show">Your Mission, should you choose to accept it...</p>
</transition>

<transition name="fade">
  <p v-if="accepted">
    You have accepted the mission, this message will self-destruct in 5...
  </p>
</transition>

<transition name="fade">
  <p v-if="declined">
    You have declined the mission, this message will self-destruct in 5...
  </p>
</transition>
```

Let's break down what happens when one of our `<p>` elements appears/disappears.
Vue will automatically listen for whether one of these elements has a CSS
transition or animation applied. If it does then these CSS transition classes
will be added/removed at the appropriate time.


## Full Component Source

This is the full source code for the component with simple transitions:

```html
<template>
  <div class="hello">
    <h1>VueJS <span>Animations</span> and <span>Transitions</span> Tutorial</h1>

    <button class="btn btn-primary" v-if="!show" v-on:click="show = !show">
      Show Mission
    </button>
    <button
      class="btn btn-primary"
      v-if="show && !accepted && !declined"
      v-on:click="accepted = true"
    >
      Accept Mission
    </button>
    <button
      class="btn btn-warning"
      v-if="show && !declined && !accepted"
      v-on:click="declined = true"
    >
      Decline Mission
    </button>

    <div class="cont center-align">
      <transition name="fade">
        <p v-if="show">Your Mission, should you choose to accept it...</p>
      </transition>

      <transition name="fade">
        <p v-if="accepted">
          You have accepted the mission, this message will self-destruct in 5...
        </p>
      </transition>

      <transition name="fade">
        <p v-if="declined">
          You have declined the mission, this message will self-destruct in 5...
        </p>
      </transition>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    name: "HelloWorld",
    data() {
      return {
        show: false,
        accepted: false,
        declined: false
      };
    }
  };
</script>

<!-- Add "scoped" attribute to limit CSS to this component only -->
<style scoped>
  .fade-enter-active,
  .fade-leave-active {
    transition: opacity 0.5s;
  }
  .fade-enter, .fade-leave-to /* .fade-leave-active below version 2.1.8 */ {
    opacity: 0;
  }

  .btn-primary {
    background-color: #256bfc;
  }
  .btn-warning {
    background-color: #c81117;
  }
  .cont {
    background-color: #000;
    width: 100%;
    height: 400px;
    margin-top: 40px;
    padding: 40px;
  }

  div {
    color: white;
  }
  h1 {
    font-weight: normal;
    color: white;
    font-weight: 100;
    font-size: 58px;
  }
  h1 span {
    font-weight: 900;
  }
</style>
```
