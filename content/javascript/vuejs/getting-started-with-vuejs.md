In this tutorial, we are going to look at how you can setup your development
environment so that you can get started writing your own VueJS.

We will be utilizing the `vue-cli` in order to start our project off and then
we'll be diving in and making a few edits, before finally building it using the
same `vue-cli`.

## Video Tutorial

## A Simple Vue App

Before I get started, it must be noted that you can get up and running really
quickly with VueJS 2 in less than 30 lines of code. Below you will find a
webpage that is a very simple VueJS page that simply prints out `Hello World` to
the browser when hit.

<div class="filename">index.html</div>

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>VueJS Starter</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="app">
        {{ message }}
    </div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue"></script>
    <script>
    new Vue({
        el: '#app',
        data() {
            return {
                message: 'Hello World'
            }
        },
        created() {
            console.log("Hello World")
        }
    });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

It should be noted though that if you want to create more advanced VueJS
applications then using the `vue-cli` going forward is recommended!

## Getting Started with the CLI

In order to get started, we'll first have to install the `vue-cli`. This can be
done using `npm`:

```bash
$ npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Once this has successfully run, you should now be able to run `vue` and it
should return the following:

<div class="filename"> $ vue</div>

```output
  Usage: vue <command> [options]


  Options:

    -V, --version  output the version number
    -h, --help     output usage information


  Commands:

    init        generate a new project from a template
    list        list available official templates
    build       prototype a new project
    help [cmd]  display help for [cmd]
```

Now that we have successfully verified our installation, we can begin our
journey into creating VueJS based applications.

## Creating Your First Application

In order to generate our first project, navigate to a new project directory and
then run the `vue create my-project` command.

<div class="filename"> $ vue create my-project</div>

```output
Vue CLI v3.4.0
‚ú®  Creating project in /path/to/project

thods instead.

```

## Running Your Application Locally

Once you've successfully initiated your basic Vuejs project, it's time to run it
locally and see it all working. You can do that by running the following
command:

<div class="filename"> $ npm run serve </div>

```output
> starter-project@1.0.0 dev /Users/elliot/Documents/Projects/tutorials/vuejs
> webpack-dev-server --inline --progress --config build/webpack.dev.conf.js

 95% emitting

 I  Your application is running here: http://localhost:8080
```

This will run a development server on `http://localhost:8080` and you will be
able to navigate to this in your browser. You should hopefully see a fully
function Vuejs application running within your browser.

Now that you have your application up and running, you are free to explore the
directories and the files generated by the `vue` cli. We shall be demystifying
what they all mean in tutorials to come.

## Building Your Application

Once you are happy with your application and want to deploy it to the likes of
an AWS S3 bucket or to your production server, you will first have to build it
by running this command:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

This will then create a `dist/` directory within your application's root
directory. This `dist/` directory contains everything your application needs in
order to run. You can then simply drop the files within this directory to your
server or S3 bucket and it will be ready to go!

## Minor Changes To Get Started

Now that we have our basic VueJS application up and running, it's time to make
some simple edits to it just to get us started. Open up the
`src/components/HelloWorld.vue` component and remove some of the default HTML
code from the `<template/>` section like so:

<div class="filename">HelloWorld.vue</div>

```html
<template>
  <div class="hello">
    <h1>{{ msg }}</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    name: "HelloWorld",
    data() {
      return {
        msg: "Welcome to Your Vue.js App"
      };
    }
  };
</script>

<!-- Add "scoped" attribute to limit CSS to this component only -->
<style scoped>
  h1,
  h2 {
    font-weight: normal;
  }
  ul {
    list-style-type: none;
    padding: 0;
  }
  li {
    display: inline-block;
    margin: 0 10px;
  }
  a {
    color: #42b983;
  }
</style>
```

When you click save and have `npm run dev` running within the console, you
should notice that it starts to rebuild everything for you. When you refresh
`http://localhost:8080` you should see your changes reflected within the
browser.

Congratulations, you have successfully built and subsequently edited your first
VueJS application!

### Further Reading

Now that you have a simple VueJS application up and running on your local
machine, it's time to try and figure out what everything means. We have made a
few changes already but in order to learn more I would recommend having a look
