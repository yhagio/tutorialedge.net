In this tutorial we’ll be having a look at how you can effectively implement
highcharts.js into your angularjs applications. We’ll be following a component
based architecture and enforcing things like one-way data-binding as is
suggested in Todd Mottos
[AngularJS Style Guide](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide).

If you already follow a component based architecture, then it should should be
very easy to integrate the code in this tutorial straight into your application
without too much fuss.

<div class="github-link">
This tutorial will be using the code from this github repo: <a href="https://github.com/elliotforbes/angular-server-dashboard">AngularJS Highcharts</a>
</div>

## Setting Up

In order to be able to use highcharts-ng, you’ll need to add a script tag that
imports the vanilla highchartsjs library:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="root" ng-strict-di lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>AngularJS Highcharts Tutorial</title>
    ...
    <!-- ADD These two imports to your index.html page. -->
    <!-- Without these, highcharts will not work -->
    <script src="//code.highcharts.com/highcharts.src.js"></script>
    <script src="./assets/js/highcharts-ng.js"></script>
    ...
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```

After we’ve imported the appropriate javascript files, we’ll then be able to add
`highcharts-ng` to our modules array like so:

```js
angular.module('root', [
        ...
         'highcharts-ng'
        ...
  ]);
```

By adding this to our modules array, it means we’ll now be able to use and see
Highcharts-ng in all of the components/controllers attached to our root module.

## Our Controller

Now that we have everything set up in order to use highcharts-ng, we can start
adding highcharts charts to our application.

Within your html file add to following:

```html
<highchart id="chart1" config="$ctrl.chartConfig"></highchart>
```

Once you have this, we’ll have to define our \$ctrl.chartConfig object, we can
do this in our Controller like so:

```js
function HighchartsController(StatsService, $log, $timeout, $scope) {
  var ctrl = this;

  ctrl.chartConfig = {
    options: {
      chart: {
        type: "area"
      }
    },

    title: {
      text: "Network Usage - Last 60 Minutes"
    },
    yAxis: {
      title: {
        text: "Throughput MBit/s"
      }
    },
    xAxis: {
      title: {
        text: "Minutes"
      },
      categories: [
        "-55",
        "-50",
        "-45",
        "-40",
        "-35",
        "-30",
        "-25",
        "-20",
        "-15",
        "-10",
        "-05",
        "0"
      ]
    },
    plotOptions: {
      line: {
        dataLabels: {
          enabled: true
        },
        enableMouseTracking: true
      }
    },
    series:
      angularjs[
        ({
          name: "Inbound",
          data: [
            29.9,
            71.5,
            25.4,
            43.2,
            37.0,
            33.0,
            35.6,
            48.5,
            21.4,
            19.1,
            16.6,
            54.4
          ]
        },
        {
          name: "Outbound",
          data: [
            19.3,
            56.3,
            23.1,
            38.5,
            32.9,
            27.0,
            30.6,
            42.3,
            17.4,
            12.0,
            9.1,
            34.0
          ]
        })
      ]
  };
}

angular.module("root").controller("HighchartsController", HighchartsController);
```

And finally we need to add the binding for our chartConfig object to our
component:

```js
var ourComponent = {
    ...
    controller: HighchartsController,
    bindings: {
        chartConfig: '<'
    }
}

angular.module('root')
    .component('ourComponent', ourComponent);
```

## Pushing Dynamic Data to the Chart

Static charts can be pretty boring at times and having to refresh the page all
the time can be time consuming. Fortunately dynamically updating our Highcharts
charts in angular is easy. All you have to do is push that values you want into
your chartConfig object and angular and highcharts handles the rest.

In the below code snippet you’ll see we are performing a shift on our data array
to remove the first element and then pushing our own random value to the same
data array every 2 seconds.

```js
ctrl.poll = function() {
  $timeout(function() {
    // Here is where you could poll a REST API or the websockets service for live data
    ctrl.chartConfig.series[0].data.shift();
    ctrl.chartConfig.series[0].data.push(Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) + 1);
    ctrl.chartConfig.series[1].data.shift();
    ctrl.chartConfig.series[1].data.push(Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) + 1);
    ctrl.poll();
  }, 2000);
};

this.$onInit = function() {
  $log.log("hello");
  ctrl.poll();
};
```

## Summary

Open up your AngularJS Application and you should see your chart rendering in
all it’s glory. If you found this tutorial useful then let me know in the
