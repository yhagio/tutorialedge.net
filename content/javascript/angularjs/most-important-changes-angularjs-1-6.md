After having a look at the AngularJS release notes for 1.6, I thought I’d
compile my thoughts together as to the most important changes to the framework
in the coming release.

## Expression Sandbox Removal

[Expression Sandbox Removal Full Notes](http://angularjs.blogspot.co.uk/2016/09/angular-16-expression-sandbox-removal.html)

The expression sandbox removal was essentially something that checked to see if
your code was accidentally accessing arbitrary javascript and discourage you
from placing any business logic inside your templates.

The expression sandbox was intended to be a security feature but exploits
continued to be found regardless of the number of patches put out. Thus the
Angular team decided to out and out remove the feature and to place to onus of
securing applications on the developers using Angular.

This will help to speed up the framework as a whole and is ultimately a good
thing,if you are developing a full stack app then you need to consider security
at all levels of your application.

## \$http Success/Error Callback Methods Deprecated

Regardless of the fact this was considered bad practice in Angular 1.5, you may
still have some of these sprawled about your codebase, in 1.6 this callback
function will be entirely removed and you will be forced to use the better
practice for making http requests:

```js
// this is the old way
$http.get(‘oauth/clients’)
    .success(function onSuccess(response){
        // use response
    })
    .error(function onError(response){
        // use error
    });


// this is the new way
$http.get('oauth/clients')
      .then(function success(response){
        $log.log(response.data);
      })
      .catch(function error(response){
        $log.log(response);
        $log.log(response.status);
        $log.log(response.headers);
      });
```

Note: the response object returned is different, if you are trying to access the
data of your response, just append .data and you should see the new content.

## Changes to ngModel

There have been some notable changes to ngModel, for instance you are no longer
able to methods to $scope.$watch without some form of context. This essentially
means you’ll have to wrap things in a function like so:

```js
// old way with no context passed
$scope.$watch("something", myNgModelCtrl.$render);
// new way with context
$scope.$watch("something", function() {
  myNgModelCtrl.$render();
});
```

## Updates to jqLite

I don’t typically use jqLite in my day to day coding but there were multiple
breaking changes to this featured in the changelog, if you do tend to use this
then I’d recommend you check out the changelog for more.
