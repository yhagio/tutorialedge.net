[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is a fantastic lightweight javascript framework that is ideal for building user interfaces in an incremental fashion. This means you don't need to start with a heavy full-fledged framework for what could be a small side-project.

If you have followed the site for some time you will know that I've been a major fan of AngularJS and then Angular 2-4 in the early days and in fairness I have only just started to scratch the surface of Vue.js and how it can be used within my dynamic, real-time applications. In this article I'll be showcasing some of the best books you can buy in order to learn the ins-and-outs of the Vue.js framework. 

> Vue.js 2 is still quite a young framework and as such the number of books available for purchase is unfortunately quite low, if you find any other great books for learning the framework then let me know in the comments section below!

# Learning Vue.js 2

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/images.tutorialedge.net/books/learning-vuejs-2.jpg" alt="best books for learning vuejs" class="book-img" /> Learning Vue.js 2 by Olga Filipova is an awesome resource for any developer looking to pick up the framework.</p>

It covers things such as building fully functioning reactive web applications from scratch, the importance of the underlying MVVM architecture and how this compares to the traditional MVC architectures of the likes of AngularJS and it covers more advanced features such as Vuex which can be used to manage your application's global state.

Overall I would highly recommend picking up a copy of this book if you want to nail the fundamentals and get up and running quickly!
