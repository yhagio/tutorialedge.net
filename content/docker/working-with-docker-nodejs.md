In this tutorial, we are going to be looking at how you can dockerize an
existing NodeJS application and ultimately leverage the benefits of Docker.
We'll be creating a Docker image that will dynamically pick up changes to a
NodeJS application and automatically recompile and rerun our application without
having to rebuild and re-run our docker image.

## Advantages of Docker

Docker offers a number of massive advantages and can drastically reduce the
friction of deploying your application to multiple platforms with minimal fuss.

New developers can easily pull down Docker-ized applications and run them with a
couple of commands on their local machine. Application developers explicitly
state within the `Dockerfile` everything that application needs in order to run.

## Our NodeJS Application

We are going to start off with a fairly simple, 6-line NodeJS Express.JS
application that will simply serve `Hello World!` when it's `/` endpoint is hit
with a `GET` request.

The application will listen on port `3000` for any incoming requests and will
map those requests against the corresponding route.

Create a new file called `app.js` within a new `node-docker` directory on your
local machine. Once this is created, add the following:

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send(`Hello World!`));

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port 3000!`);
});
```

As this uses the `express.js` library, we'll have to figure out a way of getting
this into the Docker container that will be running our application.

If you are familiar with Node.js development, you'll know that the standard
practice for this is to declare that your application requires `express.js`
within the `package.json` in your application's directory. Create this now and
add the following to the newly created file:

```js
// package.json
{
    "name": "simple-rest-api",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "main": "app.js",
    "dependencies": {
      "express": "^4.16.3"
    },
    "scripts": {
      "start": "node app.js"
    }
  }
```

> We can test if our application works locally by calling `npm install` within
> our project directory and then subsequently calling `npm run start`. You
> should then be able to navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` and be greeted
> with `Hello World!` in your browser.

## Dockerizing our Application

The aim of the game here is to get a docker image that is as thin as possible in
terms of size and is still able to provide our application with everything it
needs in order to run successfully.

We'll choose a fairly lightweight `alpine` based image from which to base our
own Docker image on top of.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:9-slim
## WORKDIR specifies the directory our
## application's code will live within
WORKDIR /app
## We copy our package.json file to our
## app directory
COPY package.json /app
## We then run npm install to install
## express for our application
RUN npm install
## We then copy the rest of our application
## to the app direcoty
COPY . /app
## We start our application by calling
## npm start.
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Now, we've done two distinct `COPY` commands within our `Dockerfile`, and the
reason for this is to reduce the time taken for us to continually rebuild our
application.

Docker automatically caches the results of each individual command so that they
don't have to be fully run each time you wish to build a Docker image. By doing
it this way, we can cache the results of our `npm install` command so that every
time we build our Docker image, it doesn't constantly have to reinstall all our
dependencies. This may not take a lot of time for this particular project, but
for larger projects, this can become a massive time drain.

### Building our Docker Image

Now that we have defined our `Dockerfile` within our application's directory, we
can go about building our Docker image. We can do this by running the following
`docker` command within our terminal.

```s
> docker build -t node-docker .
```

This will subsequently run through the 6 steps outlined within our `Dockerfile`
and build our complete Docker image.

### Running our Docker Image

Once our Docker image has been successfully built, we can then go about running
one or more Docker containers based off this image by running the following
command:

```s
> docker run -d -p 9000:3000 node-docker
```

This will start up a Docker container based off our `node-docker` docker image
and expose it on port `9000` on our machine. The `-d` flag specifies that we
wish to run this in a detached mode which means that the docker container will
run in the background on our host machine.

> It's important to note that whilst our Node.js application may be listening
> for requests on port `3000` within the code, by specifying `-p 9000:3000` we
> essentially map any requests to port `9000` from our host machine to the
> underlying docker container listening on port `3000`.

### Viewing running Docker Containers

In order to view all of the running containers on your local machine, type
`docker ps`. This should show our `node-docker` container running and the ports
that it's listening to.

## Automatically Picking up Changes

The first thing we'll have to do in order for our running Docker container to
pick up any changes is mount it to a directory on my host machine. We can
achieve this by using the `-v` flag and specifying the current directory of my
application and mapping that to the `/app` directory our application lives
within in our docker container.

We can also install and use the `nodemon` node_module in order to automatically
watch for any changes to our source files and subsequently kick off our server
with these incorporated changes.

```s
$ npm install --save nodemon
```

Now that `nodemon` has been added to our `package.json` as a
dependency, we can update our `start` command to run `nodemon`:

<div class="filename"> package.json </div>

```json
{
    "name": "simple-rest-api",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "main": "app.js",
    "dependencies": {
      "express": "^4.16.3"
    },
    "scripts": {
      "start": "nodemon"
    }
  }
```

With this change in place, we can now go ahead and rebuild our docker image:

```s
$ docker build -t node-docker-tutorial .
```

We can then run this with the `-v` flag as mentioned before like so:

```s
$ docker run -it -p 9001:3000 -v $(pwd):/app node-docker-tutorial
```

If you now navigate to `http://localhost:9001` you should see your application
up and running, if you then subsequently make any changes to the app, these
changes will be picked up and automatically reran within our container! Awesome!

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to implement a docker container that perfectly
wraps our NodeJS application. This Docker container is deployable anywhere that
can run docker which is a massive advantage! No more worrying about the fact
that "it works on my machine".
