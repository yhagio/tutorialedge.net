In this tutorial, we are going to be taking a look at what Docker is, why it's
needed and how you can get up and running using Docker in your day-to-day
development.

## What Is Docker?

Docker is a containerization technology that allows you to package up your
application into something that will run everywhere that Docker can run.

You typically define absolutely everything you need for your application within
your docker file and no more. If your application is a Java application, then
you would typically use a Java-based Docker image that would have the exact
version of the JVM that you need.

By specifying only what your application needs, you end up with lightweight
containers that can be scheduled and ran side-by-side.

## Why Should You Use Docker?

Imagine you were working in a development team that spanned across the world. In
this team you were working on a number of different microservices that all
pieced together to form one larger system.

If all of these microservices were written in different languages and required
various environment variables to be set or exact versions of programming
languages such as Python, Go, Node to be used. Setting up your machine to
support the development of these various microservices could be difficult and
you might find yourself spending hours on getting your configuration just right.

By using Docker, we can remove this issue almost entirely. Each microservice
would come with its own `Dockerfile` within the root of the repository. This
`Dockerfile` would contain everything each of your microservices would need in
order to run.

In order to run and develop one of these microservices, you would simply have to
pull the project down and run the appropriate `docker run` command with
appropriate flags and your microservice would be started on your local machine.
You would no longer have to spend hours trying to get everything just right and
you could dive right into the codebase and start making changes.

## Installation

Docker can be installed by navigating to this page:
[Docker Download](https://www.docker.com) and clicking the download button.

Once you have Docker installed on your machine, you should be able to run
`docker` commands from the terminal. Running just `docker` by itself should
return a list of everything you can do with the `docker` binary:

```s
➜  tutorialedge.net git:(master) ✗ docker

Usage:  docker COMMAND

A self-sufficient runtime for containers

Options:
      --config string      Location of client config files (default "/Users/elliot/.docker")
  -D, --debug              Enable debug mode
  -H, --host list          Daemon socket(s) to connect to
  -l, --log-level string   Set the logging level ("debug"|"info"|"warn"|"error"|"fatal") (default "info")
      --tls                Use TLS; implied by --tlsverify
      --tlscacert string   Trust certs signed only by this CA (default "/Users/elliot/.docker/ca.pem")
      --tlscert string     Path to TLS certificate file (default "/Users/elliot/.docker/cert.pem")
      --tlskey string      Path to TLS key file (default "/Users/elliot/.docker/key.pem")
      --tlsverify          Use TLS and verify the remote
  -v, --version            Print version information and quit
... and so on
```

## A Simple Python Docker Application

Let's have a shot at writing our own Docker based application that uses Python
and serves a very simple REST API over port 3000.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.6.3
WORKDIR /app
ADD . /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Now, let's have a look at how we would go about implementing our `app.py` python
application:

```py
from flask import Flask
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World"

if __name__ == "__main__":
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
```

Now, in order to run this, we would first have to build our image using the
`docker build` command passing in the name of the image we wish to build using
the `-t` flag and specifying where our `Dockerfile` exists with the `.` at the
end of the command like so:

```s
docker build -t py36-account-service .
```

We then want to run our newly created `py36-account-service` image by utilizing
the `docker run` command specifying the name of our container as
`py36-account-service`, that we wish to run this in a detached mode with `-d`
and the port we wish to expose with `-p`. We want to access this application
through port `9000` locally but within the container our application will be
running on port `80`, so we specify `9000:80` to map these two ports together
and forward any traffic hitting `http://localhost:9000` into our container and
subsequently to our application.

Finally we specify the image we wish to build our container from by appending
`py36-account-service` to the end of our command:

```s
docker run --name "py36-account-service" -d -p 9000:80 py36-account-service
```

## Benefits

The main benefits of Docker-izing the above Python program would be that if it
is reliant on the particular version of Python we specified, another developer
wouldn't have to worry about getting this installed on their machine. They would
simply have to have `docker` installed on their machine and then they would run
that above `docker run` command and their service would start up and be exposed
on port 9000.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we looked at what Docker is, and how you can use it to improve
the way that you develop software. We created a really simple NodeJS project
that used Docker and we launched this Docker application using the `docker run`
command.
