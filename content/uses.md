I'm constantly getting questions on what software/plugins/hardware I use to record my YouTube videos so I thought I'd write it up in one convenient place and just link this whenever the question pops up!

> ðŸ§™ **Note** - This was inspired by Wes Bos, who I am huge fan of! This list will be a living
document that I will update whenever anything changes!  

Here's a photo of my setup as it stands today:

### Editor + Terminal

* [_Visual Studio Code_](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - My editor of choice for pretty much everything from Node,
 to Python, to Golang. It's an excellent bit of software that can be extended to suit 
 pretty much everyone's needs.
    * _Cobolt2 Theme_ - Courtesy of Wes Bos, the Cobolt2 Theme looks incredible. 
* [_iTerm2_](https://www.iterm2.com/) - My Terminal of choice which has awesome features such as tabs and split 
screen capabilities for running multiple things side by side!
* [_Alfred 3_](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - I've just started working with Alfred but find it an excellent tool for
improving how I use my machine! It's incredibly fast although I've yet to play about
with any workflows yet! 
* [_Todoist_](https://todoist.com/?lang=en) - A really cool task management tool which
helps me organize what I need to do!

### Recording Setup

* [_Blue Yeti Microphone_](https://amzn.to/2ObIcR3) - I've used the Blue Yeti Microphone since the start of my YouTube career and I have never found any issue with it. This is an excellent
USB microphone that has really stood the test of time! 
* [_Blue Radius III Custom ShockMount_](https://amzn.to/2FiQnZd) - An awesome shock mount which
helps to isolate the microphone from any knocks or bumps when I'm recording. 
* [_Adjustable Microphone Boom for Blue Yeti Mics_](https://amzn.to/2Tbz0go) 
* _ScreenFlow 8_ - This is an incredible bit of software which makes screen recording
an absolute dream.

### Hardware

* [_MacBook Pro 15" 2017_](https://amzn.to/2ObI83R) - This is the beast that powers absolutely
everything. I went for the 16GB RAM, 512GB of SSD model with the 4GB Intel Radeon Pro 560.  
* [_Apple Space Gray Magic Keyboard_](https://amzn.to/2THgmSJ) - I've just recently updated to this
new space gray keyboard and it looks stunning as part of my setup. I'm a huge fan of the slightly
bigger keyboard with the number pad and additional buttons so far.
* [_Logitech MX Master 2S Wireless Mouse_](https://amzn.to/2HDVZyK) - Another recent upgrade as I felt myself going through loads of batteries with my old mouse. This is fully wireless and rechargeable which is exactly what I need from a mouse.  
* [_LG 34" - 27UK850 Monitor_](https://amzn.to/2UBuBoJ) - This is my main 4k and it's an absolute
dream to work with. Making the leap from standard 1080p up to this monitor has greatly improved
my workflow and given me soo much more screen real-estate to play with!
* [_Dell UH2414h 24" Monitor_](https://amzn.to/2XZBp1r) - I still have 1 of my 2 Dell 1080p monitors in my setup as I do like having a vertical monitor for general coding + writing.
