# TutorialEdge.net

## General Information

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elliotforbes/tutorialedge-v2.svg?branch=master)

I've been working on TutorialEdge.net as a hobby project since early 2015. Since
then it's gone from only a handful of visitors per day to something that
attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors per year.

The main aim for the site is for it to be a place that I can host tutorials and
courses on any language and framework I choose and hopefully give back something
to the programming community.

This website is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an open-source static
site generator.

## Usage

1. Download the repo

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/elliotforbes/tutorialedge-v2
   cd tutorialedge-v2
   ```

2. [Install hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)

3. Start the server: `hugo server`

4. Open the address in a browser (default is localhost:1313)
